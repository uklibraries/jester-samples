jester-samples
==============

This is a collection of sample inputs and outputs for [jester](https://github.com/uklibraries/jester/). It is intended to serve as a suite of regression tests for jester upgrades.

The inputs were generated by employees of the [University of Kentucky Libraries](https://libraries.uky.edu). For information about permissions to reproduce or publish, contact the [Special Collections Research Center](https://libraries.uky.edu/ContactSCRC).

The outputs were generated by a production version of jester over multiple sessions from 2022 to 2025.

This collection was assembled by MLE Slone in 2025.
