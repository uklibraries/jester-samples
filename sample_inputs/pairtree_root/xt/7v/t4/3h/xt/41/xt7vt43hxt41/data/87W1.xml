    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Bourbon Furnace, established in 1791, was the first iron furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains. It was located three miles south of Owingsville, Ky. in Bath County and was owned and operated by John Cockey Owings and Company. In 1795 Thomas Deye Owings, of Cockeyville, Md., moved to Kentucky at the request of this father, John Cockey Owings, to assume the management of the company. Originally built for the purpose of casting ten gallon kettles for the boiling of saline water for salt, the furnace began to diversify its products with the demand for other manufactured iron utensils and implements. During the War of 1812 the request for iron increased because of the requirements of war, and orders for cannon balls, canister and grapeshot came to the Bourbon Furnace.</p><p>Colonel Owings continued to operate the Bourbon Furnace until 1822 when he failed financially, after which time the property was sold under various court orders, subsequently purchased by Robert Wickliffe of Lexington and operated by him until the furnace went out of blast in 1838.</p>  </bioghist>
