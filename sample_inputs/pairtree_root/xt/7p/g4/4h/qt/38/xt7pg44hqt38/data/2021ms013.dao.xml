    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky was the only Vice President of the United States elected by the Senate pursuant to the Twelfth Constitutional Amendment, which kicked in when, as in the 1836 elections, no vice presidential candidate received a majority of the electoral votes. He achieved fame for having allegedly killed Tecumseh during the War of 1812. But he also gained notoriety for his open relationship with Julia Chinn, an enslaved woman with whom he had two children. The Democrats dumped him from their ticket when Van Buren ran unsuccessfully for a second term. In 1839 General Samuel Milroy, who resided in Delphi Indiana, was appointed agent for the Miami and Pottawatomie Indians. He was replaced in June 1841, under the Admnistration of John Tyler.</p>  </bioghist>

The letter additionally comments on the administration of Tyler, who as Vice President became President as a Whig after the death of William Henry Harrison. Jonson says in the letter that despite Tyler's Whig affiliation, he has <emph render="doublequote">no doubt Tyler inclines to appoint democrats to office.</emph></p>  </scopecontent>
