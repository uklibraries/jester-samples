    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Shirley Gill Pettus travel diary (dated 1929; 0.04 cubic feet; 1 folder) comprises one diary that documents a trip abroad taken by Shirley Gill Pettus to Europe in 1929. In the diary, Pettus listed the hotels she stayed at, her friends and persons she met on her trip, and which ship she sailed on to reach Europe. Her entries include descriptions of the ship - her opinions on her lodgings, the food, and company had while onboard. Once in Europe, her tour takes her to Scotland, England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and France. Pettus details the sights she visited, museums toured, riding trams, meals they ate, friends they met along the way, and opinions of the different cities they visited. Pettus provides good details of the antics she and her friends get up to while traveling to, through, and back from Europe.</p><p>The Shirley Gill Pettus travel diary collection is part of the Wade Hall Collection of American Letters, which includes correspondence and diaries from all over North America covering the time period of the Civil to Korean Wars. The materials were collected by Wade Hall and document everyday men and women.</p>  </scopecontent>
