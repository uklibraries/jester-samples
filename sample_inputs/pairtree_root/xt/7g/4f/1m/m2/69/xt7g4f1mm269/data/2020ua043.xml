    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Valerie Still, basketball player and coach, musician, historian, author, educator, consultant, and philanthropist, was born in Camden, New Jersey, on May 14, 1961. Her family included her father and mother, James Fleming Still (1922-1995) and Gwendolyn Ricketts Still (1931-2010), and nine brothers and sisters including former professional football player Art Barry Still (1955- ). After playing basketball at Cherry Hill High School East in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, she enrolled at the University of Kentucky in 1979, joining the basketball team from 1979-1983 and becoming the highest scoring basketball player, male or female, in the history of University of Kentucky basketball with 2,763 points and 1,525 rebounds. After leaving school to play professionally in Italy, she returned to the University of Kentucky and recieved her Bachelor of Science in Animal Science/Pre-Veterinary Medicine in 2000. She received a Master of Arts degree in African American Studies in 2007 followed by a doctorate in Sports Humanities at The Ohio State University. Professionally, she played in Italy for 12 years, winning an Italian Professional Basketball Championship. Still became one of the most popular and dominant players in the league, with numerous all-star appearances and scoring titles. She returned to the United States in 1996 and received two championships with Columbus Quest for the American Basketball League (ABL). After the ABL closed, she joined the Washington Mystics in the Woman's National Basketball Association (WNBA). After retiring from playing, she was an assistant coach in the WNBA with the Mystics and later with the Orlando Miracle.</p><p>Still is founder of the Valerie Still Foundation and the socially-conscious coffee company STILL Java.  She is also a published author and co-owner of STILL Publications and is co-founder president of the Dr. Clarence B. Jones Institute for Social Advocacy. She has served as a newspaper columnist, host of various television shows, participant on a reality television show, and a live and recording musician. A youth series based on her family history, <title render="italic">Still Alive on the Underground Railroad: Recollections of an American Family,</title> was released in 2012 and 2013. Still published two memoirs, <title render="italic">Playing Black and Blue: Still I Rise</title> (STILL Productions) and <title render="italic">Still Family: An Historic American Family Memoir</title> (University Press of Kentucky) in 2018 and 2025, respectively. From 2024-2025, she served on the Executive Planning Committee for the Lexington (Kentucky) Freedom Train Project, raising funds to erect a monument to abolitionists Lewis and Harriet Hayden.  Still has also established the <title render="doublequote">University of Kentucky Athletics: Women's Basketball Oral History Project</title> at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History in the University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections Research Center.    </p><p>Still has received many honors and awards, including induction into the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame (1996), the University of Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame (the only woman in the inaugural class, 2005), Camden County Sports Fall of Fame (2018), Woman's Basketball Hall of Fame (Class of 2019), the University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni (2020, inducted 2021), the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame (2023), and University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment Distinguisehd Alumni (2024).  In 2018, she received the New Jersey State Governor's Jefferson Award for her volunteer/public service work.</p><p>Still's ancestors include abolitionist William Still (known as the <emph render="doublequote">father of the Underground Railroad</emph>) and Dr. James Still (Still's great-great grandfather and William's older brother), who became a successful 19th-century physician.   In 2005, Still campaigned for and petitioned the State of New Jersey to preserve Dr. James Still's medical office in Medford, New Jersey.  In 2006, it became the first and only state-owned African American historic site in New Jersey. Still has a son, Aaron, with her former husband, Rob Lock.  They were married from 1995-2007. </p><p>Sources:
