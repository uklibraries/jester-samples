    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Following the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), the resource-rich eastern Kentucky mountains became highly sought after due to large amounts of salt, coal, and timber. Many corporations flowed into the region during the 1870s through the 1920s, seeking to secure land - and particularly mineral or subsurface rights - in order to extract the resources (PBS, 2006). </p><p>Key to this expropriation of the land was the surveying of the land. Surveying entails using <emph render="doublequote">known recorded and non-recorded documents, witness evidence, field survey measurements and deed computation analysis</emph> of property (Commonwealth Surveying, 2021). This data is then used for <emph render="doublequote">lacing the property corners, determining land area, locating improvements, determining encroachments, planning for future projects, preparing a survey plat and deed description and making legal presentations</emph> (Commonwealth Surveying, 2021). </p><p>The original Smith, Skidmore, Ledford Land Grant was a large county order patent that overlapped most of Southeastern Harlan County, from the Cumberland Gap to Cranks Creek in the eastern edge of Harlan County. Prior to 1867, Harlan County encompassed the eastern side of what is now Bell County. Multiple land grants had been made in the area by the Commonwealth of Virginia and later Kentucky. Prior to this huge grant, Virginia and later Kentucky, did not have a system to detect or eliminate overlapping surveys before the issuance of additional land grants. Nineteenth century courts were busy resolving all of the competing claims to land . Often these claims litigated unresolved due to disinterest of land owners or inability to litigate due to lack of funds to process or enter a claim.</p><p>The Smith, Skidmore, Ledford patent was obtained with the idea that it would cover all unclaimed property and overlap claims to earlier patented property. Harlan County had substantial coal and timber reserves. After the chaos of the Civil War, northern financial groups were interested in consolidating these disparate tracts for commercial mining and timbering.</p><p>In this particular case (Smith, Skidmore, Ledford Patent) a group led by Warren Delano, Jr., (uncle of  president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt) purchased the Smith, Skidmore, Ledford patent through Boyd Dickerson.  Land agents from the group would approach superior title land owners of mineral properties and ask if they were interested in an offer to buy the property. If the property owner refused to sell they would threaten a quiet title action against the land owner to settle the title, to be tried in U.S. District court in Covington, Ky., 250 miles away.  Most of these land owners did not have the financial means to contest or assert their title.  The result was that the land owners sold out and the Delano Group formed Kentenia Land Company consisting of about 33,000 acres. For the next eighty years Kentenia Land Co. leased coal mining rights to various companies until selling to a land division of the Norfolk &amp; Southern Railroad in 1980 which holds title to the land today.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Boyd-Dickerson field survey books and patent maps (dated 1884-1990, undated); 5.35 cubic feet; 1 box; 3 folders; 6 tubes) comprise field notebooks and maps for coal, lumber, and development company properties in southeastern Kentucky (including Bell, Harlan, Knox, Leslie, Letcher, and Perry counties), tract maps for areas within these counties (including the aforementioned counties as well as Clay and Whitley counties), forest service maps (portions of the Daniel Boone National Forest and portions of Bell, Breathitt, Harlan, Knox, Leslie, Owsley, and Perry counties), company operators' properties (including those of A.J. Asher, John L. Cornett, F.E. Gatliff, James and William S. Howard, and Andrew J. Short Smith), and patent maps (including the Ledford, Skidmore and Smith patents in Harlan County and Greasy Creek in Leslie and Harlan Counties). These maps and survey books represent the attempts by the Delano Group, later the Kentenia Corporation to locate the interfering patents on the ground to assert their title claims to the properties. A history of northern industrialists that started the age of  resource extraction from Appalachia. </p><p>The Boyd-Dickerson survey was part of an effort to demarcate property boundaries and to help facilitate the extraction of resources such as coal and lumber from these Kentucky counties. The survey's notebook collection from 1884 details handwritten notes on the surveying of southeastern Kentucky, covering portions of Bell, Clay, Harlan, Knox, Leslie, Letcher, Perry, and Whitley counties. The survey allowed for coal, lumber, and development companies to stake their claims, demonstrating which areas they controlled, sought to control, and where resource deposits lay. </p><p>The Boyd-Dickerson survey notebooks include the surveyors' notes on connecting lines, interfering patents, meanders, field notes, and an index for the surveying work conducted during 1884. Per the Bureau of Land Management, connecting lines mark the connection between two surveys, while patents demonstrate legal title to a property. Meanders refer to measures made around the banks or shores of navigable streams and other permanent bodies of water (Bureau of Land Management, 2003). There are also the surveyors' field notes and an index. </p><p>The Boyd-Dickerson maps include maps from 1904-1990, as well as several undated maps. These maps detail coal, lumber, and development companies properties, tract maps, forest service maps, company operators' properties (A.J. Asher, John L. Cornett, F.E. Gatliff, James and William S. Howard, Andrew J. Short Smith) and patent maps. </p><p>Companies documented in this collection include: Asher Coal Mining Company, Bell Coal Company, Black Mountain Corporation, Black Star Coal Corporation, Blackwood Land Company, Blue Diamond Coal Company, Crummies Creek Coal Company, Cumberland Valley Land Company, E.B. Coal Company, Harlan Wallins Coal Corporation, H.C.M. Company, Intermountain Coal and Lumber Company, Kentenia Corporation, Kentucky River Coal Corporation, Kentucky and West Virginia Coal and Mining Company, Peabody Coal Company, Pioneer Coal Company, Pocahontas Development Corporation, Southern Mining Company, and Vizard Investment Company. </p>  </scopecontent>
