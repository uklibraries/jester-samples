<p>The Howard Sherman Gleason State College photograph album (dated 1901; 0.7 cubic feet; 1 flat box) comprises an album of photographs taken by State College (Lexington, Kentucky) undergraduate student Howard Sherman Gleason during the 1901 academic year. Includes photographs of the campus; exterior and interior of the mechanical/engineering buildings and laboratories; as well as other classroom, laboratory, and residence hall interiors; individual men and women students (including Gleason); military drills; and groups of students at social, sporting, or leisure events. Some of the photograph locations or buildings are identified, but many are not. None of the people are identified. Many of the images are faded or overexposed. Includes a photograph of two men each holding a camera; a photograph titled, <emph render="doublequote">Heroes of the Broom</emph> showing three unidentified African American men sitting on steps, perhaps State College janitors, each holding a broom and dustpan; and a photograph of a young man dressed in women's clothing posed with a young man dressed in men's clothing.</p>  </scopecontent>
