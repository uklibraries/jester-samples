    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Iva Dagley was born in September 1898 in Kentucky. She taught langagues at Millersburg College before receiving a scholarship to study music in Paris, France. She performed as a rising opera singer at the New York Metropolitan Opera until the Great Depression sent her back to Lexington where she taught music at the University of Kentucky and later Henry Clay High School.</p><p>Iva Dagley lived at Aylesford (Elley Villa) at 320 Linden Walk in Lexington. Aylesford house was built in 1851 and used as a hospital during the Civil War. She had no family and rented the unused upstairs bedrooms to college students. Iva died in February 1982 and was buried in the Lexington Cemetery. She had no surviving relatives, and left a trust for a scholarship to go to a Henry Clay student majoring or minoring in a world language. This $2,000 scholarship is only given out every 4 years and is renewable each year as long as the student continues their studies in a world language.</p>  </bioghist>
