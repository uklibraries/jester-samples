    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Postlethwait Tavern was established in 1797 by Captain John Postlethwait in Lexington, Kentucky. The tavern was frequented by both common people and prominent individuals. Horse racing was growing in popularity at the time, and the tavern aided it's development by selling pools for the races. The tavern became a hotspot for horse racing enthusiests because of this. </p><p>In the summer of 1833, the Postlethwait Tavern became the center of the Lexington, Kentucky cholera epidemic. The tavern likely used water contaminated by the disease, and due to the tavern's popularity the disease spread rapidly. The disease would claim the lives of about 500 Lexington citizens, including John Postlethwait. </p><p>After two fires, the tavern was rebuilt in around 1820 and renamed the Phoenix Hotel. It remained a Lexington landmark until it was torn down in the early 1980s.</p><p>Sources: </p><p>Jacob Baird and T. C.
