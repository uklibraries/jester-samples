    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Stanley Forman Reed was an associate justice on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1938 to 1957. Over the course of more than seventy years of public service, Reed was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly, served in the presidential administrations of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and considered numerous significant cases on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Reed was born in Minerva, Mason County, Kentucky, on December 31, 1884. He was the only child of Dr. John A. and Frances Forman Reed. In 1902, he graduated from Kentucky Wesleyan College and then went on to Yale University, where he earned bachelor's degrees in economics and history. Reed attended the University of Virginia Law School in 1907 but withdrew from the university after one year.</p><p>On May 11, 1908, Reed married Winifred Elgin, a daughter of a prominent family in Maysville, Kentucky. The new couple moved to New York City, where Reed continued his legal studies at Columbia University for a year. In 1909, the Reeds traveled to Europe, where they combined a delayed honeymoon with Reed's study in civil and international law at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.</p><p>In 1911, the couple returned to Maysville, where Reed was admitted to the bar and began practicing law. He maintained a solo practice for nine years before joining the local firm of Worthington, Cochran, Browning &amp; Reed in 1919. Two of the firm's principal clients were the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad and the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative Association. Reed had been active in the organization of the tobacco cooperative and became their general counsel in 1922.</p><p>Alongside private practice, Reed pursued his interest in Democratic Party politics. In 1911, he represented Maysville in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his two terms, he introduced child labor and workmen's compensation legislation. Reed also served as chairman of the Kentucky Young Men's Democratic League for the 1912 Woodrow Wilson presidential campaign. In 1918 he entered the United States Army, serving as a first lieutenant until the end of World War I.</p><p>When the Herbert Hoover administration established the Federal Farm Board in 1929, Reed joined the agency and left Kentucky to begin a long career in Washington, D.C. Upon the recommendation of James C. Stone, who had been president of the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative and was then vice chairman of the Federal Farm Board, Reed, though a Democrat, was appointed the Board's general counsel.</p><p>Late in 1932, the Hoover administration promoted Reed to the position of general counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). The RFC was Hoover's chief agency designed to ease the country's economic depression by granting loans to banks and businesses. When President Roosevelt took office, he retained Reed in that position while his administration broadened the scope and influence of the RFC.</p><p>In an attempt to increase prices, the Roosevelt administration proposed reductions to the gold content of the dollar. Attorney General Homer Cummings asked Reed to assist in meeting the legal challenge to the government's right to cancel clauses in private contracts which required payment in gold. When he successfully argued a Gold Clause case, <emph render="italic">United States vs. Bankers Trust Co.</emph> (1935) before the Supreme Court, Reed won the admiration and confidence of both Cummings and Roosevelt.</p><p>In March 1935, the president appointed Reed as solicitor general of the United States. In this post, he represented the federal government before the Supreme Court. Reed's three years in this position spanned a challenging period in the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) history, as the OSG defended the constitutionality of the New Deal's experimental legislation before a skeptical Court. Reed saw success with cases such as <emph render="italic">Ashwander vs. Tennessee Valley Authority </emph> (1936), in which the Court upheld the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, and in <emph render="italic">Alabama Power Co. vs. Ickes </emph> (1938), in which the Court reaffirmed the concept of federal aid to public power projects. He also experienced losses, as when the Court declared the National Industrial Recovery Act unconstitutional in <emph render="italic">A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</emph> (1935), and again when the Agricultural Adjustment Act was invalidated in <emph render="italic">United States vs. Butler</emph> (1936).</p><p>In January 1938, Associate Justice George Sutherland announced his retirement from the Supreme Court. Roosevelt immediately nominated Reed to fill the vacancy, and the Senate quickly confirmed the president's second appointment to the highest court. Over the next nineteen years that Reed served on the bench, the Court addressed pivotal questions concerning communism, the rights of criminal defendants, the civil rights of Black Americans,  separation of powers, presidential war powers, executive authority, and the relationship between government regulation and private economic enterprise. Reed wrote majority opinions in notable cases including <emph render="italic">Smith v. Allwright</emph> (1944) and <emph render="italic">Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia (1946)</emph>, and notable dissents in cases such as <emph render="italic">Adamson v. California</emph> (1947) and <emph render="italic">Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education</emph> (1948). In 1954, he joined the majority in <emph render="italic">Brown v. Board of Education in Topeka, Kansas</emph>, which ended legal racial segregation in public schools. Reed had intended to write a dissent upholding the right of states to impose segregation on Black and white public school students. In the end, however, he decided to abandon his dissent and join the unanimous decision written by the recently confirmed Chief Justice Earl Warren. </p><p>As the Warren Court began to take shape in the 1950s, Reed found himself increasingly in the minority, dissenting from decisions that he considered "kryotocracy," or rule by judges. On January 31, 1957, he announced his retirement from the Court and stepped down on February 25. He still remained active in federal service, however. Within weeks of retirement, he began to sit by designation on the Court of Claims and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which he would continue to do for years afterward. In 1958, Chief Justice Earl Warren appointed him special master in <emph render="italic">Commonwealth of Virginia v. Maryland</emph> (1963), a case in which the two states litigated fishing and oystering rights in the Potomac River. </p><p>Reed also continued to be an active part of the Court's social and ceremonial activities for at least a decade after retirement. Finally, in 1976, he and Winnifred left D.C. and moved to the Hilaire Farm Nursing Home in Huntington, New York. He passed away there four years later on April 2, 1980. Stanley Reed died at the age of 96, having lived longer than any prior justice.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Stanley Forman Reed papers (dated 1856-1981, bulk 1935-1969; 207.29 cubic feet; 454 document boxes, eight oversize scrapbooks, 16 textile items, and two map folders) comprise correspondence, notes, memoranda, judicial opinions, docket books, case files, speeches, reports, research materials, press releases, news clippings, photographs, publications and print materials, and memorabilia spanning nearly seventy years of public, private, and professional life. The bulk of the collection documents his work as an associate justice on the Supreme Court from 1938 to 1957; these materials were likely organized and maintained by Helen Gaylord, Reed's secretary for more than thirty years (1935-1969) with the assistance of various law clerks over the years. There are also papers related to Reed and his wife Winnifred's personal lives and relationships with family and friends in Kentucky and Washington D.C. The majority of materials consists of documents, but formats in the collection also include photographs, audiocassettes, textiles, plaques and other three-dimensional objects. </p><p>Reed's correspondents include Hugo Black, Louis Brandeis, William J. Brennan, Warren Burger, Harold Burton, Thomas C. Clark, William O. Douglass, Felix Frankfurter, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. Among other subjects, materials document Kentucky politics, the New Deal era, the World War II era, postwar development of the international economic and financial order, and the Supreme Court's postwar jurisprudence on civil rights, civil liberties, and other major constitutional issues. </p><p>The collection is arranged into fifteen series: Early career; U.S. Solicitor General; U.S. Supreme Court; U.S. Courts of Appeals; U.S. Court of Claims; Other professional activities; Administrative files; Correspondence; News clippings; Personal papers; Publications; Speeches; Subject files; Photographs; and Memorabilia.</p>  </scopecontent>

varying sizes documenting Reed's public career and private life. Photographs of his personal life include Reed's infancy and childhood, college and law school years, family vacations, weddings, and class reunions. Photographs of his public life include group portraits with staff and colleagues from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Solicitor General's office, and the Supreme Court. Also included are images from events such as the inauguration of Alben Barkley as the thirty-fifth vice president of the United States, as well as luncheons, dinners, and events hosted by bar associations, colleges and universities, civic groups, and other organizations. There are also a number of individual portraits of Reed as solicitor general and Supreme Court justice; many of these are categorized by the studio that took the pictures.
