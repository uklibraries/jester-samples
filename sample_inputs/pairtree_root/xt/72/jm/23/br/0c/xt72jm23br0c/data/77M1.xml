    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The public career of Albert B. <emph render="doublequote">Happy</emph> Chandler began in 1928 and spanned a fifty year period, highlighted by two terms as Governor of Kentucky, six years as United States Senator and a tenure as Commissioner of Baseball.</p><p>Albert Benjamin Chandler, son of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler, was born July 14, 1898, in Corydon, Kentucky. After graduating from Corydon High School in 1917, Chandler entered Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1921 Chandler graduated with a bachelor's degree in history and political science. Chandler entered Harvard Law School in the fall of 1921, but after one year returned to the University of Kentucky to complete his legal education. While at the University of Kentucky coached women's basketball, football at Versailles High School, was assistant football coach at Centre College in the nineteen-twenties.</p><p>Chandler set up a law practice in Versailles, Kentucky, in 1925. The same year he married Mildred Watkins of Keysville, Virginia, a teacher at Margaret Hall School for Girls. They had four children: Marcella, Mimi, Ben and Dan. </p><p>Chandler's public career began with his appointment as Master Commissioner of Woodford County in 1928. The next year he was elected state senator representing the twenty-second district. At the 1931 Kentucky Democratic convention Chandler was selected to run as Lieutenant Governor on a ticket with Ruby Laffoon. By this time his political activities had come under the guidance of Ben Johnson and J. Dan Talbott of Bardstown. In the 1931 election he was elected Lieutenant Governor over Republican John C. Worsham, while Ruby Laffoon became Governor.</p><p>Chandler and Laffoon split over Laffoon's sales tax bill, and in the Governor's absence from the state in 1935, Chandler called a special session of the legislature to enact a compulsory primary law. This law required that party nominations be made by a primary election and not by a convention, which Laffoon and his supporters might well control. Chandler trailed Tom Rhea in the first primary of 1935 but won the runoff, then defeated Republican King Swope to become the Governor of Kentucky. </p><p>Chandler's first gubernatorial administration is known for the reorganization of Kentucky state government. Chandler had the new sales tax repealed and through reorganization, reform, frugality, and higher excise and income taxes, financed far-reaching improvements in schools, roads, health and welfare programs, and penal institutions. The Government Reorganization Act of 1936 created a more efficient administration and Chandler was able to pay off much of the state's debt. Among the most significant innovations were the free textbook program, participation in the federal rural electrification program, establishment of a teachers' retirement system and an old-age assistance program, and the start of a special rural roads program. Although friendly to labor, Chandler opposed closed shops and sit-down strikes, and he sent the National Guard into Harlan County to curb labor-related violence there. </p><p>Prohibited by law from succeeding himself as governor, Chandler unsuccessfully challenged Alben Barkley, United States Senate Majority Leader, in the 1938 primary. Chandler resigned as governor, and on October 10, 1939, when Lt. Gov. Keen Johnson succeeded him, Johnson appointed Chandler to the U.S. Senate. In 1940 Chandler won a special election for the rest of Logan's term, and in a controversial 1942 campaign he defeated John Y. Brown, Sr., and won a full six-year term.</p><p>In Washington, Chandler usually backed the Roosevelt administration although he opposed some of the New Deal fiscal policies and the decision to give priority to the war in Europe over the Pacific conflict during World War Two. Chandler toured the Aleutian Islands and was instrumental in strengthening U.S. defenses in the Alaskan Area and was one of six senators selected to make a world-wide tour of U.S. military installations in 1943. On November 1, 1945, Chandler resigned from the Senate to become national commissioner of baseball. During the next six years, black players entered the major leagues for the first time and a players' pension fund was established. Chandler's bid for a second contract was defeated by baseball owners in 1951, after which he returned to Versailles, Kentucky, to practice law. He was president of West Virginia Fuel Corporation, belonged to the Boards of Directors of the Coastal States Life Insurance Company and Irving Air Chute Company, and served as president of International Baseball Congress in the early 1950s. </p><p>In 1955, Chandler won the Democratic nomination for governor over Bert T. Combs, despite the opposition of many of the party's most powerful leaders. He achieved victory in the gubernatorial election over Republican Edwin R. Denney. In his second term as Governor of Kentucky, Chandler achieved improvements in the highway program using a $100 million bond issue, the schools, and other public institutions. Addition funding went to the public schools' Minimum Foundation Program and the teachers' retirement system. His proudest accomplishment was the establishment of the University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Medical Center. He attracted national notice in 1956 when he used state police and National Guardsmen to enforce desegregation in the public schools. </p><p>Chandler failed in bids for the nomination for governor in 1963, 1967 and 1971. Two incidents in the late 1980s involving alleged racial slurs led to unsuccessful demands for Chandler's resignation or removal from the board. Chandler died on June 15, 1991, at his home in Versailles and was buried in the cemetery of Pisgah Presbyterian Church in Woodford County, Kentucky.</p>  </bioghist>

A majority of the papers in the series came from Senator Chandler's Versailles office. Unfortunately the material generated from his Washington office is incomplete. The Senatorial Series consists of seven files which are arranged according to significance. Within each file, the papers are arranged chronologically and/or alphabetically. The files are: Important Papers File, Political File, Correspondence, Washington-Versailles Office Correspondence, General Correspondence, Miscellaneous File, Invitation File, Walter W. Mulbry Personal Correspondence.</p><p>Chandler, who resigned as governor in 1939 to accept an appointment to the U.S. Senate replacing the late M.M. Logan, was elected in a 1940 special election to the seat to complete Logan's term and was re-elected for a full term in 1942. The Senator was a member of the Military Affairs Committee and was chairman of a sub-committee which visited Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in 1942. In 1943 Chandler made a global tour of U.S. military installations as a member of a Senate inspection team. He also served on the Mines and Mining, Privileges and Elections, Interoceanic Canals, and Judiciary Committees.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref1466_nx7"

The files are: General Correspondence, Political File, Subject File, University of Kentucky Organization within each file is alphabetical or chronological. </p><p> Materials in the Series reflect Chandler's varied activities during the decade of the 1960s. He was twice a candidate for governor. In 1963 he challenged the Bert T. Combs administration's candidate in a bitterly fought Democratic primary. He ran again in the 1967 gubernatorial primary. Chandler was politically active in other state elections and mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate for George Wallace's American Independent Party ticket in 1968. In addition to politics, Chandler retained an interest in sports. He served as commissioner of the Continental Football League from 1965 to 1966. His interest in the University of Kentucky, always strong, resulted in Governor Louie Nunn naming him a member of the Board of Trustees in 1968.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_1bdd9afb6c522058ffe5919cfd061450" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>Sub-Series A.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/772849</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1960-1969</unitdate></did><c03 id="aspace_ref4876_syz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aaron - Ahrens</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/764578</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1960-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_6a76df59bd5d2dbd3990c17d979676b8" label="mixed materials" type="box">452</container><container id="aspace_04edcb8e8a94129049acd21c146ac392" parent="aspace_6a76df59bd5d2dbd3990c17d979676b8" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref4877_set" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aker - Alumni</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/764579</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1960-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_b75eb39ccb7d6cd478f983a3569673c6" label="mixed materials" type="box">452</container><container id="aspace_8e0d650abeec8181464c965919e80a7f" parent="aspace_b75eb39ccb7d6cd478f983a3569673c6" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref4878_m0g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alverson, Jess</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/764580</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1960-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_8cd28640c23e7cf7e50bc54acdb2d320" label="mixed materials" type="box">452</container><container id="aspace_70b2314d8e3010bd62337c1d7d41b64a" parent="aspace_8cd28640c23e7cf7e50bc54acdb2d320" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref4879_ur1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alvey - Anderson, J.
