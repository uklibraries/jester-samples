Again, having no success, he spent a year slowly acquiriting subscribers, and only when His Majesty George IV signed for <title render="italic">The Birds of America</title> and set the fashion in his favor was Audubon confident that his life's work would appear in its finished form. Acting as his own publisher, he found in Robert Havell, Jr. the engraver that his standards required. Birds of America, in elephant folio size, began to appear in parts in 1827, and quickly realized critical and financial success. In late 1828, Audubon was just beginning to realize a profit from <title render="italic">The Birds of America</title>. He was anxious to convince his wife , Lucy, to join him in London. In a signed letter of 1828 to his eldest son, Victor, then a clerk in Louisville, Audubon writes from London of his desire to have his family join him. In addition, he describes the status of <title render="italic">The Birds of America</title>. He writes, <emph render="doublequote">I will send you what I call the first volume of my voluminous work in about 2 months. It will be bound in sepia leather and will be a monument to my having existed.</emph></p> </scopecontent> </c>
