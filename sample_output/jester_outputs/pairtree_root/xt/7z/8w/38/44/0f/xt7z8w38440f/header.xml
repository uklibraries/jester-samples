          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Winfield Scott (1786-1866) was born on a plantation in Virginia to Ann Mason and William Scott.  He initially persued law as a profession before joining the United States military in 1807.  Scott had attained the rank of brevet major general by 1815 for his service in the War of 1812.  He led the force which started the Trail of Tears in 1838, forcing Cherokees off their lands in Georgia.  Scott became the Commanding General of the United States Army in 1841 and retained his role until his retirement from the military in 1861.</p><p>After three unsuccessful campaigns for the Whig presidential nomination, Winfield Scott won the nomination in 1852.  Scott was not a popular candidate, and his defeat by the Democratic Franklin Pierce was the worst loss in Whig history.</p>
