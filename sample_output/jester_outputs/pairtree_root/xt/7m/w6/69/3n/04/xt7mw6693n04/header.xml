      <p>Jesse Hilton Stuart was born in W-Hollow near Riverton in Greenup County, Kentucky, in 1907. The son of an illiterate farmer, Stuart is recognized as an outstanding regional author. In 1929 he received an A.B. degree from Lincoln Memorial University and attended Vanderbilt University in 1931-1932, studying there when <emph render="doublequote">The Fugitive Poets,</emph> a group of poets and scholars, were active. When his 19 stanza poem <title render="italic">Elegy for Mitch Stewart</title> was published by the <title render="italic">American Mercury</title> magazine in 1933, Stuart credited Robert Penn Warren and Donald Davidson for encouraging him to submit his work. Stuart had a distinguished career in Kentucky as a school teacher, principal and eventually superintendent of Greenup County Schools. He achieved fame, however, as a poet and writer of short stories, novels and articles. Stuart was honored by Lincoln Memorial University in 1942 with a Ph.D. in Human Letters and in 1954 was named poet laureate of eastern Kentucky by the Kentucky legislature. Jesse Stuart married Naomi Dean Norris and they had one daughter, Jane.</p>
