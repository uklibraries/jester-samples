      <p>Henry C. Mayer (1927-2007) was born in Jefferson County, Kentucky on November 17, 1927 to Florence Rapp. Mayer attended Notre Dame University, earning a B.A. in journalism and a M.A. in philosophy, before serving in the Korean War. While in the army, Mayer reached the rank of Private First Class and was stationed in Japan for eighteen months. </p><p>Returning to Kentucky, Mayer worked from 1955-1965 primarily in various roles within the Kentucky state government, as well as with various advertising agencies. From 1965-1973, he was self-employed running a writing and research assistance business, including various freelance projects. In 1973, Mayer resumed his work within the Kentucky state government and advertising, which he continued to do until 1981 before returning to his writing and research assistance and teaching as a visiting faculty member at the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, and Eastern Kentucky University. During his second stint in state government and advertising, Mayer married Barbara Zehnder on October 23, 1976 in Jefferson County, Kentucky. </p><p>Mayer was involved in numerous activities and organizations within Kentucky, including service on the Governor's Task Force on Welfare Reform in 1979, several years as the chair on the Committee on Public Issues, membership on the executive council of the Association for Social Economics, several years as a delegate to the Annual Assembly of the Kentucky Council of Churches, several years as a board member of the Kentuckiana Hemophilia Foundation, multiple terms as a Legislative Agent to the Kentucky General Assembly, and many other local state, national, and topical organizations. </p><p>Mayer's writing covered a wide range of topics, including state and federal government programs with impacts on Kentucky, St. Xavier High School (Louisville, KY), unemployment, a column on opera and the Louisville Orchestra, various expressions of ministry for religious publications, coal mining, mine disasters, current events in the coal industry, labor relations, Southern Baptist controversies, histories of banking in two mountain counties and undated histories of two local Roman Catholic parishes. </p><p>Mayer passed away on December 23, 2007 and was buried in Radcliff, Kentucky in the Kentucky Veterans Cemetery Central. </p><p>Sources: </p><p>Ancestry.com.
