          <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The precursor to the Gender and Women's Department, the Women's Studies (WS) Program, was established when the standing Dean of Undergraduate Studies, John B. Stephenson, approved Women's Studies as a topical major in 1973. The Women's Studies Program remained a topical major and an academic minor that was primarily housed in other academic departments from 1973-2009, with courses such as <title render="doublequote">Women in Literature</title> and <title render="doublequote">Education in Other Nations</title> offered through the English and Education departments respectively. As the WS Program continued to grow, from 1976-1989, the WS Program was able to bring in more faculty members through dual appointments, such as Karen Tice (Educational Policy Studies and Evaluation) and Joan Callahan (Philosophy), which allowed the Program to more consistently offer courses directly through Women's Studies, such as <title render="doublequote">Race, Class, and Gender</title> and <title render="doublequote">Introduction to Women's Studies in the Social Sciences.</title> This trajectory continued until, in 2002, under the direction of the acting director of the WS Program, Joan Callahan, the WS Program was moved from Patterson Office Tower to Breckinridge Hall with the African-American Studies and Research Program. With the two programs housed together, the university hired Patricia Hill Collins to be the Bryan Chair of Women's Studies and African-American Studies in 2002. The Bryan Chair was established by a nearly $3 million donation from William T. Bryan, a 1936 College of Engineering graduate. Collins was hired with the goal of integrating both programs more into the university and the surrounding Lexington, Kentucky, community.</p><p>Under the direction of Callahan and Collins, the WS Program brought in a series of new hires and new courses, which provided the necessary resources to have an undergraduate topical major and academic minor primarily supported by WS Program-listed courses. In 2002, the WS Program added <title render="doublequote">cross-cultural</title> courses as requirements for participation in the undergraduate program. Furthermore, in 2002, the Associate Dean of Research and Graduate Studies, James E. O'Reilly, approved the WS Program's Graduate Certificate curricula, which allowed the Program to offer in-house graduate-level courses, such as WS 616, which integrated the cross-cultural requirements into the WS graduate certificate. While there had been a WS graduate certificate offered since 1995, the changes described in the 2002 memo from James E. O'Reilly document the approval of in-house graduate-level courses offered by the WS Program directly. From 2002-2008, the WS Program continued to develop a more focused curricula, with courses such as <title render="doublequote">Feminist Theory,</title> <title render="doublequote">Post-Colonialism,</title> and <title render="doublequote">Transnational Feminism</title> highlighting the continuing independence of the WS Program. This continued until 2009, when the WS Program became an official academic department renamed Gender and Women's Studies (GWS), which offered a full undergraduate major and minor, and, in 2013, a fully independent graduate program. </p><p>The WS Program and GWS Department have also integrated into the university and local Lexington, Kentucky, area through a combination of artistic, social, and academic events. Starting in at least 1985, the WS Program hosted and co-sponsored film showings, guest speakers, and artistic events that focused primarily on issues of race, disability, and sexuality. Many of the events were oriented towards both academic research and social/political activism--such as the <title render="doublequote">Take Back the Night</title> events, which ranged from 1999-2003, and the Film Series events, ranging from at least 2001-2010--and were intended to integrate academic research and feminist thought with artistic representation for a public audience. As the WS Program shifted from a topical major and Program to an academic research department, the events moved towards bringing in more academic guest speakers and <title render="doublequote">Research Matters</title> brown bag events starting in 2008. Beyond the events directly hosted and sponsored by the WS Program and GWS Department, the Department co-sponsored and affiliated with a number of academic departments (such as African American and Africana Studies), community outreach programs, and the university at-large to bring in events that were aligned with the educational and social goals of the Department. Similar to the events directly hosted by the Department, the affiliated and co-sponsored events have been a combination of social, artistic, and academic events, with the focus shifting to academic events and speakers from 2005-onward.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>1. 2014ua041.
