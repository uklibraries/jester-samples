      <p>Louis Wagner Arnett was born at Mundy's Landing on the banks of the Kentucky River in Woodford County, Kentucky, on July 10, 1879, to Benjamin M. and Jennie Barkley Arnett. He attended public schools before enrolling at the University of Kentucky.  Arnett finished his education at the University of Michigan; in 1899, he received the degree of Bachelor of Laws. As law associate of Kentucky Governor William Goebel, Arnett became an active member of the Democratic Party and a friend of many of Kentucky's most prominent 20th century politicians. He represented Kenton County in the state House of Representative for two terms from 1906-1908 and served in the state Senate in 1909. In the late 1920s, Arnett organized the Young Democratic Club movement, which eventually grew to 20,000 members. He remained active in state politics until his death in 1953.</p><p>Bidwell, William E. <title render="italic">Legislative History and Capitol Souvenier of Kentucky</title>.
