      <p>Dorothy Annabelle Caldwell (1909-2004) was a volunteer courier with the Frontier Nursing Service in the 1930s. Her family moved from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Boone County, Kentucky, in the 1940s. Dorothy became a teacher and cared for her blind brother, John A. Caldwell, Jr. on their family farm in Boone County. Both of Dorothy's parents were involved in healthcare; her father, Dr. John Alexander Caldwell, Jr. (1877-1958) was a prominent surgeon and physician in Cincinnati while her mother, Orpha Cornelia Featherstone (1874-1968) was a trained nurse. Dorothy's paternal grandfather, Judge John Alexander Caldwell, Sr. (1852-1927) was the Mayor of Cincinnati, an Ohio congressman, and the Lt. Governor of Ohio.</p>
