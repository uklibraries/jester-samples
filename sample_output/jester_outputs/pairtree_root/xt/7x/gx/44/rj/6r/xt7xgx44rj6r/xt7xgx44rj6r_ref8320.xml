The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) was designed to open up isolated areas so that economic development could occur. The ADHS connects at strategic points to interstate highways and is laid out so that most of the Region's population is no more than thirty minutes away from either an interstate or an Appalachian highway. At the end of FY 2010, of the 3,090 miles authorized to be improved, 2,715.1 were completed or under construction.</p> <p>Periodic studies of the cost to complete the highway system were developed to be a basis for allocation of authorized and appropriated funds among the states.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref8321" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8325" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8328" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8453" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8694" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8714" level="file"/> <c id="ref8743" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8752" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8761" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8765" level="subseries"/> </c>
