Annual reports, informational documents for local governments, and project reports are included. The project reports in this category differ from those in "Final Project Reports", Boxes 357-539. Generally, these projects were funded by federal agencies other than the ARC, or a state agency; and, an ARC contract number does not appear on the item so it was assumed that the ARC did not fund the project. However, since contractors did not always adhere to uniform formats in their reports, it is possible that documents in this section were actually funded by the ARC.</p> <p>Arranged alphabetically by state, then by district, the documents are in chronological order within each district. Reports which are multi-district or statewide follow the district subdivisions for each state.</p> <p>All publications that are designated "Oversize" are located in the last box in the series (See Box 772).</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref7133" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7229" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7322" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7483" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7504" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7549" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7639" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7706" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7750" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7911" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7958" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8065" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref8178" level="subseries"/> </c>
