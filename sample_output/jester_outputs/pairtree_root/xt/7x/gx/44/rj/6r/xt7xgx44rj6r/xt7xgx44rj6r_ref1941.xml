Prior to 1975, the ARC's focus on planning was to assist the states in their annual development plans and then bring each plan together under one cover: Appalachian Plan.</p> <p>These materials document the process of creating a coordinated overall regional plan encompassing "local, state, and federal development efforts for the best use of public funds and the stimulation of private investment for development." The Plan's aim was to provide regional guidance in planning as well as a policy framework for the ARC program.</p> <p>The making of the Regional Plan was a form of self-study and evaluation for the ARC. See "1970 Evaluation' (Boxes 167-169) and "Program Design" (Boxes 187-195), also in this section, for earlier evaluations to compare how methods varied.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1942" level="file"/> <c id="ref1943" level="file"/> <c id="ref1944" level="file"/> <c id="ref1945" level="file"/> <c id="ref1946" level="file"/> <c id="ref1947" level="file"/> <c id="ref1948" level="file"/> <c id="ref1949" level="file"/> <c id="ref1950" level="file"/> <c id="ref1951" level="file"/> <c id="ref1952" level="subseries"/> </c>
