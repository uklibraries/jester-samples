The next heading is "General Information" including Chair, Executive Director, Congressional Delegations and a breakdown of LDD Administrative funding for the current fiscal year, and ARC funding since 1965. Two survey responses make up the next category: A 1984 ARC-LDD survey and the NARC (National Association of Regional Councils) Survey of Regional Activities. Lists of board and staff members, and projects funded by the ARC make up the next two divisions. The "Newsletter" category also contains pamphlets and brochures. The last three sections are "Socio-Economic Data", "Other Information" and a "Transition Statement" proposing a survival plan in the event that the ARC is terminated.</p> <p>The profiles are arranged alphabetically by state and then by development district. The date on each folder entry signifies when that profile was last updated.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref7050" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7059" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7066" level="file"/> <c id="ref7076" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7078" level="file"/> <c id="ref7083" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7087" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7094" level="file"/> <c id="ref7098" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7106" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref7108" level="file"/> <c id="ref7114" level="file"/> <c id="ref7120" level="file"/> </c>
