After each state conducted studies focusing on the projected impact of recession and hearings were conducted in 1982, legislation was passed extending the Appalachian Regional Development Act. It was a crucial time, however, and these files reflect the crisis.</p> <p>The categories from 1980-1983 include Congressional District Impact Statements from each member state, Futures Material, Hearings, Ideas, Legislation and General. "Futures Material" contains notes for and rough drafts of projected yearly plans. "Ideas" contains material such as ARC staff suggestions and a work program for the report to Congress; "Hearings" contains material such as anticipated Congressional questions regarding programs and in-depth responses, and statements given during the 1982 hearings by Senators, Governors, and witnesses.</p> <p>These documents portray the time and effort expended towards fiscal survival and redirecting Commission program priorities to emphasize highway completion. The Finish-Up strategy was projected for 3-5 years, but the ARC succeeded in maintaining diminished but ongoing Congressional funding support and the mandate to disband it was removed.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1745" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1763" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1780" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1797" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1807" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1826" level="subseries"/> </c>
