The 1974 Water Resources Development Act authorized the Corps of Engineers to develop a comprehensive flood protection plan for the Tug Valley. The USCOE contracted with ABT Associates, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to do detailed historical, demographic, economic and land use studies. The USCOE was also responsible for dredging stream beds, dam construction and repair, plus housing/business relocation above the flood plain. The CADP provided local community contact with the USCOE and assisted in obtaining right of entry permission where needed. They also coordinated the activities of planning groups. The ARC supervised and acted as liaison for the project.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1832" level="file"/> <c id="ref1833" level="file"/> <c id="ref1834" level="file"/> <c id="ref1835" level="file"/> <c id="ref1836" level="file"/> <c id="ref1837" level="file"/> <c id="ref1838" level="file"/> <c id="ref1839" level="file"/> <c id="ref1840" level="file"/> <c id="ref1841" level="file"/> <c id="ref1842" level="file"/> <c id="ref1843" level="file"/> <c id="ref1844" level="file"/> <c id="ref1845" level="file"/> <c id="ref1846" level="file"/> <c id="ref1847" level="file"/> <c id="ref1848" level="file"/> <c id="ref1849" level="file"/> <c id="ref1850" level="file"/> <c id="ref1851" level="file"/> <c id="ref1852" level="file"/> <c id="ref1853" level="subseries"/> </c>
