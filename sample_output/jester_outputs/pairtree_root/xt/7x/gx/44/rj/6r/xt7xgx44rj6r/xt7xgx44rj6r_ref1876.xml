Conducted from 1972-1975, the bulk of the study was done in 1973-1974.</p> <p>The ARC staff solicited program assessments from outsiders who were familiar with the programs, including mayors, Local Development District (LDD) staff and Board members, and former managers of ARC-funded projects. These reports and opinions were used by staff in evaluating the program and planning future program emphases.</p> <p>The files are arranged by topic, e.g. Housing, Education, Environment, etc. There are also "General" files and several files from an oversight committee.</p> <p>The "General" files contain Commission correspondence between ARC staff, state officials and Commission members which gives overviews of meetings, future plans and reports on post-program design activities.</p> <p>The Institutional Development Strategy subcommittee, composed of appointed Commission members and staff, acted as an oversight committee to coordinate the time schedules for the topical program activities. They also served as liaison for the Executive Director and Federal Co-chairs, and compiled the individual reports into summary documents.</p> <p>These records were collected by ARC staff member, Paige Ingraham.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1877" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1882" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1885" level="file"/> <c id="ref1886" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1890" level="file"/> <c id="ref1891" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1896" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1899" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1906" level="file"/> <c id="ref1907" level="file"/> <c id="ref1908" level="file"/> <c id="ref1909" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1915" level="file"/> <c id="ref1916" level="file"/> <c id="ref1917" level="file"/> <c id="ref1918" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1921" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1927" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1931" level="subseries"/> </c>
