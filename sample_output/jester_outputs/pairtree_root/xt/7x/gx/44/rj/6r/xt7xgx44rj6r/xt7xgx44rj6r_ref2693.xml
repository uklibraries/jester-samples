These files, covering 1966-1974, include information on early ARC efforts to address housing issues; Section 207 amendment of the Appalachian Regional Development Act; Urban America, whose mandate was to ameliorate urban substandard housing; the model program "New Towns"; participating state files containing reports and correspondence; and legislation.</p> <p>In 1967, Congress authorized the ARC to provide housing assistance by making loans and grants for planning and by obtaining insured mortgages through the National Housing Act. The mandate was broadened in 1971 with the Section 207 amendment. It provided monies for site development and off-site improvement grants for housing projects including building infrastructures--water lines, sewers, and roads to housing sites. Section 207 also provided technical assistance such as the establishment of housing finance agencies. Urban America was contracted to study Kentucky and West Virginia, targeted because of their severe housing problems. This study resulted in legislation creating the West Virginia Housing Development Fund. Other states such as Kentucky and Georgia followed with the model program, New Towns, incorporating ideas from the HUD prototype of existing planned towns--New Communities in Selected European Countries.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref2694" level="file"/> <c id="ref2695" level="file"/> <c id="ref2696" level="file"/> <c id="ref2697" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2705" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2713" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2721" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2728" level="subseries"/> </c>
