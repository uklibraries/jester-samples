These counties were declared disaster areas as a result of floods during the spring of 1977. The counties were located in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Funding for a three year period was provided by the ARC. These activities were in addition to the Tug Fork Project and done cooperatively with the USCOE.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1867" level="file"/> <c id="ref1868" level="file"/> <c id="ref1869" level="file"/> <c id="ref1870" level="file"/> <c id="ref1871" level="file"/> </c>
