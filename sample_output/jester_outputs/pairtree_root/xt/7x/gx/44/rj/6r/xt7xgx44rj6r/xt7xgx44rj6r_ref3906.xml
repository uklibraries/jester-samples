It is divided into three categories: project reports that are site-specific and, therefore, arranged by state; those that are regional in scope; and finally, "Program Analyses", reports in which the main purpose was evaluation.</p> <p>Project reports were placed in this section if, somewhere on the document, funding credit is given to the ARC or if an ARC contract number appears on the item. Other project reports are located in the last section, Local Development Districts--Publications and Reports (See Boxes 660-771).</p> <p>Each entry is arranged:</p> <p> Title/ author; date. Project number (if available)</p> <p>Often the reports have only contract numbers (e.g. 66-100) which were simply accession numbers for the ARC. These numbers are not included in an entry. Project numbers usually, but not always, take the form: KY-0000-00-I-201-0000. The first two letters indicate the general source of money from which the funding came-- in this example, the money originated from funds allocated to Kentucky projects; the number, 201, represents the program category, "Highways". Since this entire inventory can be keyword searched, it is possible for a researcher to see all project reports that fall into a particular program category, if that report has a project number.</p> <p>All reports which are marked "OVERSIZE" refer to the Box and Folder number where that item is located.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref3907" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4122" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4277" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4500" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4631" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4697" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4820" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref4983" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref5084" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref5499" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref5577" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref5672" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref5765" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref5899" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref6454" level="subseries"/> </c>
