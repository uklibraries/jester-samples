      <p>Beatty Buehler, Lexington, Kentucky, was the State Republican Chairwoman in 1935.  She was the co-organizer of the State's Republican Women's Club founded in 1928 and its first president (1928-1931).  In 1931 Buehler was the Republican nominee for the state office of Secretary of State. </p><p>Born in Somerset, Kentucky, Beatty was the youngest child of Judge Simeon and Mary E. Hicks.  In 1902 she married Captain Harry F. Buehler of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Harry had worked as a Coal Operator in Beaver District, near Somerset, and owned land used for oil drilling. They had one child, Miss Curtis Buehler. Following her husband's death in 1906, she returned to Kentucky from Pennsylvania and entered the insurance business. Buehler also worked as a court reporter in the 28th judicial district.  In addition, she served as Deputy Circuit Court Clerk and studied law with Judge T. Z. Morrow, the father of Governor Edwin P. Morrow.</p><p>In 1918, Buehler moved to Lexington to head the Buehler Insurance Agency.  She also served as the Secretary/Treasurer of the Flahaven Land Company whose holding included timber and oil lands.  In addition, she was the President of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Lexington and a member of the Altrusa Club. Beatty Buehler died in 1971 at the age of 92. She lived her final years with her daughter in Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>Sources:
