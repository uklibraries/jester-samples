          <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Bell Court Neighborhood Association was formed in 1962 and incorporated in 1965. Its primary purpose was to further the preservtion and improvement of the Bell Court neighborhood through charitable, educational or scientific activities. The Bell Court neighborhood was defined as including all residences, businesses and other entities bounded by the west side of Walton Avenue, the north side of Main Street, the east side of Indiana Avenue and the north side of Boonesboro Avenue.</p><p>The Bell Court neighborhood was developed around the turn of the 20th century as a middle class neighborhood. There are 157 buildings in the district most of which are homes built in the Victorian or Queen Anne styles. The most notable house in the neighborhood is known as Bell Place, owned and eventually donated to the city of Lexington by Clara Bell Walsh. Bell Place was designed by Lexington architect Thomas Lewinski and combines both Greek Revival and Romanesque features. It was constructed for Henry and Clarissa Bell beginning in 1845.  Other notable pieces of architecture in Bell Court Historic Neighborhood District are the Episcopal Church of Good Shepherd and Clay Villa, the oldest home in the neighborhood. </p><p>
