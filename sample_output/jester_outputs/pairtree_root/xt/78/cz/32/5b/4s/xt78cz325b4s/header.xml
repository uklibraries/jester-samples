Her father was a millwright and had built Lemon &amp; Flournoy Mills at Newtown, Scott County, Kentucky. At age 15, Lucy (then called <title render="doublequote">Miss Lucie</title>) began teaching school in Jessamine and Woodford County public schools. She married Hugh McCauley, a farmer in Jessamine County. Lucy taught in Keene and Troy schools, boarded with students, and returned home to the farm on the weekends. In 1885, she opened Locust Grove Seminary, a private boarding school using her and Hugh's home as the location. Lucy McCauley remained teaching until a brief illness before her death on October 8, 1915.  </p><p>Sources:
