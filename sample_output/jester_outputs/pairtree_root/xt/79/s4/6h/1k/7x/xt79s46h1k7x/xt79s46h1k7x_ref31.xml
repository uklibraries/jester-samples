Charles, an enslaved Black boy about 16 or 18 years old, was sold by his enslaver, John Barry of Bourbon County, Kentucky, through the enslaver's attorney, William Barry, for 110 pounds (February 28, 1805). Robin, an enslaved Black man about 19 years old, and Harvey, an enslaved Black boy about 11 or 12 years old, had already been enslaved by John W. Hunt for some time. They were officially sold by their enslaver, John Postethwait, for $500 on April 12, 1805.</p> <p>This folder also contains several of John W. Hunt's account statements for goods purchased from various businessmen and multiple letters to John Wesley Hunt regarding whiskey sales, details of his trade business, and land. Several letters contain details of Hunt's new horse business. Blossom, a horse in the possession of Samuel Wells, did exceptionally well and covered more than 70 mares during this season, and Highlander, a horse in the possession of Peter Lott, was another good breeding horse purchase.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
