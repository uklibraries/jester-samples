          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>John Wesley Hunt came to Lexington, Kentucky, from Trenton, New Jersey, in 1796. He opened a general store and later became a wholesale trader in cotton, tobacco, saltpeter, and especially hemp. He was also involved in horse breeding and in banking. His daughter Henrietta married Calvin Cogswell Morgan, and her son, Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, became famous during the Civil War for his daring raids. Her grandson, Thomas Hunt Morgan, won the 1933 Nobel Prize for medicine for his discoveries about the laws and mechanisms of heredity.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Hunt-Morgan family papers (dated 1784-1949; 16.39 cubic feet; 42 boxes, 4 items) consist of correspondence, business records, financial and legal papers photographs, and diaries of the Hunt-Morgan family, which document their family and business lives as upper class citizens of Lexington, Kentucky. The Hunt-Morgan family papers contain many records documenting the lives of enslaved persons in Lexington, Kentucky as well as in other parts of the southern United States, as the family enslaved dozens of people in the first half of the 19th century. There are also numerous bills of sale and transaction records documenting the sales, purchases, and rentals of enslaved persons in the 1800s. The collection includes John Wesley Hunt's business records and correspondence, which deal with riverboat trade on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, business conditions in Cincinnati, Lexington, and New Orleans, and the operation of his general store. There are also letters from his family in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, describing life in that area, including details of the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic in the late 1700s. This collection also has production logs detailing work done by enslaved persons in John Hunt Morgan and Calvin Cogswell Morgan Jr.'s hemp factory in the 1850s (Box 29) and a souvenir book from the Ohio Penitentiary with photos of the prison as well as persons imprisoned there from 1899 (Box 35). </p><p>Additionally, the collection includes numerous Civil War-era letters, diaries, and newspaper articles, some of them about the exploits of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. Twentieth-century materials include Thomas Hunt Morgan's childhood letters and the letters his wife wrote to his mother, records and correspondence relating to the Morgan Heirs Land Co., and notes about General John Hunt Morgan for a book on which his nephew was assisting. There are scrapbooks, ledgers, maps, geneaological data, and a group of family portraits, which have been removed to the library's Photographic Archives (PA63M202).</p>

Several letters are addressed to Calvin Cogswell Morgan or to both Calvin C. Morgan and John Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, discussing financial matters and the wool business.  A letter to C.C. Morgan from J.C. Hawkings claims the enslaved persons on the New Uncle Sam are well "with the exception of a few grumblers" (March 19, 1861), however, a letter from Lunsford P. Yandell Junior says he has examined the men on the steamer and suggests they be removed at once due to their poor health (April 5, 1861).  Thomas Morgan wrote several letters to his mother, Henrietta Morgan, discussing his high grades in school, his belief that Kentucky should join the Confederacy, and his desire to hang President Lincoln in effigy.</p>

        <p>Folder 5:12 comprises correspondence to and from Confederate soldier, Charles Howard, and his wife, Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard, while Mr. Howard was in a Union prison along with outside correspondence also concerning Charles Howard's prisoner status.  Howard frequently asked his wife to send supplies and asked her not to send too detailed letters because the Union censor read everything.  A letter from William H. Seward to Major General Nathaniel P. Banks informs him a delegation had met with President Lincoln to request Howard's release and Lincoln left the responsibility with Banks (July 5, 1861).  On September 15, 1861, Frank Howard wrote a letter informing his father, Charles Howard, that he had also been arrested by Union soldiers.</p>

Nearly all of the letters in this folder are either to or from Charles Howard or his wife, Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard, while he was imprisoned by the Union Army for his Confederate beliefs. Letters to Charles Howard from Dr. Coale discuss their business together.  Letters to Mr. Howard from his wife discuss her life at home in Baltimore, Maryland; news of family and friends; and plans to offer Mr. Howard parole.   One letter from Mrs. Howard comments on the disrespect she has perceived from the servants and the escape of some of the Black persons they enslave (May 9, 1862).  Letters to Elizabeth P.K. Howard from her husband discuss his anticipation of spending the summer imprisoned; instructions on handling their rental properties; and his impending transfer from Fort Warren, Massachusetts, to Fort Lafayette, New York.</p>

Several of the letters were exchanged between Mr. and Mrs. Howard.  Charles Howard wrote to his wife advising her and the girls to keep safe at home, asking about their sons in the Confederate Army, and discussing a new bill in Congress concerning political prisoners.  Elizabeth P.K. Howard wrote to her husband informing him she and all their children are safe, complaining about Federal officers and Union supporters, telling of rumors about the war, and giving details of a burglary in the neighborhood and the subsequent arrest of the thieves.  One letter from Elizabeth P.K. Howard to her husband noted that it had been exactly one year since Mr. Howard's arrest (July 1, 1862).</p>
        <p>Folder 16:7 is almost entirely composed of letters in addition to a freight bill and an open letter written by Colonel Thomas Jefferson Cram of Sudbrook, Maryland, instructing Union soldiers that Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard and her family were not to be harassed by order of Union General John Ellis Wool.  All other letters were either written by or to Charles Howard or his wife, Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard, while Mr. Howard was imprisoned by Union officers.  Several of the letters were written between Mr. and Mrs. Howard.  Mrs. Howard discussed her visit to Sudbrook, Maryland; the illness of Betsey, one of the family servants; a recent battle that left her concerned for the fate of their sons and friends; their daughter Lizzie falling ill; and her plans to visit their son Eddy after he was taken prisoner by Union soldiers.  Mr. Howard wrote of his isolation, asks for flowers for a prisoner who presses them as a hobby and shirts for himself, a recent uptick in letter censorship, and his outrage at an illegal search of their home by city police.</p>
        <p>Folder 16:8 is entirely composed of letters written by or to Charles Howard or his wife, Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard, during his time spent imprisoned by Union officials.

Letters from Mr. Howard to Mrs. Howard discuss his receipt of provisions she sent, concern about a visit from her pro-Union sister, politics influencing the Church, and his love for her.  Edward Lloyd Howard wrote to his mother, Elizabeth P.K. Howard, asking for provisions (October 3, 1862) and she offered to do all she could for his comfort including taking a room near the prison (October 5, 1862).  A letter from Charles Howard in Baltimore, Maryland, to Colonel J. Dimick thanks him for releasing Howard from his terms of parole (December 2, 1862).</p>

        <p>This folder comprises numerous letters, the majority of which were written to Charlton Hunt Morgan Sr. or Jr., in addition to two bills made out to Charlton Hunt Morgan Sr. and his wife, Ellen Key Morgan, of Lexington, Kentucky, for groceries and clothing and a confirmation of Charlton Hunt Morgan's subscription to the "Public Opinion Company" in Washington, D.C.  The majority of the letters written to Charlton Hunt Morgan Jr. and his father regard their unsuccessful attempts to find him a job in Lexington, Kentucky, as he was not enjoying life in St. Louis, Missouri.  Some letters to Charlton H. Morgan Sr. discuss his nephew, Calvin Cogswell Morgan III's, continued battle with malaria.  A letter to Charlton H. Morgan from his sister, Henrietta Duke, advises him not to testify against Madeline Pollard in the famous Pollard-Breckinridge case and encloses a newspaper clipping about the matter (February 25, 1894).</p>

        <p>This folder contains several pieces of correspondence, almost all of which were written to or between members of the Morgan family, along with bills and receipts documenting purchases made by members of the family, an invitation to the wedding of Mary Lawrence and Albert Finley France, and court documents from a case between the Scott family and members of the Morgan family regarding land in Douglas County, Wisconsin, given away in Calvin Cogswell Morgan's will.  Several letters addressed to Captain Charlton Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, discuss the famous Pollard-Breckinridge case from both angles.  Morgan's sister Henrietta Duke and her husband General Basil Duke stood firmly on the side of Madeline Pollard, while sister Katherine Morgan Forsyth and Fletcher Johnston voiced support for Congressman William Breckinridge.  In a letter addressed to Mrs. Morgan, Louise Breckinridge, the congressman's new wife, said she wanted to talk but was staying silent at her husband's advice (March 20, 1894).  Letters written to John Hunt Morgan later in the year from his lawyer, Thomas W. Shackleford, advise on the ongoing property lawsuit against the Scott family.</p>
