Morgan [May 26, 1934]; receipts and bills for purchases made by Ellen "Nellie" Key Howard Morgan in Lexington, Kentucky; checks written by Nellie K.H. Morgan; and two signed statements of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan's soldiers saying there was no way General Morgan and his men robbed a bank in Mt. Sterling during the raid. John Hunt Morgan wrote and received several letters regarding the passing of his wife, Virginia J. Morgan; loans he had taken out with various establishments; and details of his attempts to sell valuable possessions including a watercolor by Hugh W. Williams, a portrait by Thomas Sully, jewelry, clothing, rare books, stamps, and furniture. A few letters from March and April discuss outrage at the portrayal of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan in a new book about to be published and attempt to prove that the rumors being spread about him were false.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
