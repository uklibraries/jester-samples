It contains short notes and lists, directions for pills, and copies of letters. The letters deal primarily with the arrangement of surrender and parole of Union officers to John Hunt Morgan on June 11, 1864, and one on June 21 which gives greater details. This folder also contains some letters dealing with Calvin C. Morgan's captivity later in the year.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
