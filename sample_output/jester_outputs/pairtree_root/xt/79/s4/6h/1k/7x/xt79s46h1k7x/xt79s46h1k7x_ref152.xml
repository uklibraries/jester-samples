Morgan on the steamer New Uncle Sam, an account of sales, a receipt from Tellkampf and Kitching, a bill for shoes and repairs, envelopes, a memorandum of bills payable, and a lithograph of Ascension Hall at Kenyon College in Ohio. Most letters written to Calvin C. Morgan and John H. Morgan regard wool sales and financial matters. A letter from Thomas B. Merein Junior of Frankfort, Kentucky, invites Calvin C. Morgan to meet informally with Governor Beriah Magoffin (December 6, 1860).</p> <p>There is also an account of wages earned by persons enslaved by Calvin C. Morgan on the steamer New Uncle Sam (December 14, 1860) and an account documenting the rental of these persons with a receipt (December 28, 1860). A letter from J. Hawkins in Memphis, Tennessee, to Calvin C. Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, informs him of the New Uncle Sam's arrival and that payment is to be made for the hiring of enslaved persons, claiming they are well but in need of clothes (December 12, 1860). However, a letter written on December 28, 1860, recounts the complaints of enslaved persons on the boat as to their conditions.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
