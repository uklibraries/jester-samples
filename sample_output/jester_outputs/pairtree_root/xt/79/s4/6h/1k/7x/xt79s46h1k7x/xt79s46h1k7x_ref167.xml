Bowman for $36.80. Most of the letters are written by or to members of the Hunt-Morgan family. Letters to Henrietta Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, from her sons, Calvin Cogswell Morgan in Ohio Penitentiary and Richard Curd Morgan in a military prison in Louisville, Kentucky, discuss their lives as Confederate prisoners and give details of arrangements to have their brother Charlton paroled. Several letters between the Morgans give family news and life updates.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
