Several letters addressed to Captain Charlton Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, discuss the famous Pollard-Breckinridge case from both angles. Morgan's sister Henrietta Duke and her husband General Basil Duke stood firmly on the side of Madeline Pollard, while sister Katherine Morgan Forsyth and Fletcher Johnston voiced support for Congressman William Breckinridge. In a letter addressed to Mrs. Morgan, Louise Breckinridge, the congressman's new wife, said she wanted to talk but was staying silent at her husband's advice (March 20, 1894). Letters written to John Hunt Morgan later in the year from his lawyer, Thomas W. Shackleford, advise on the ongoing property lawsuit against the Scott family.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
