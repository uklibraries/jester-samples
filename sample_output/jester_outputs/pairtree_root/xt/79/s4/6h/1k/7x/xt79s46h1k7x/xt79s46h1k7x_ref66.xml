James, an enslaved Black boy about 15 years old, and Joseph, an enslaved Black boy about 13 years old, were both described as perfectly sound by their former enslaver, William Fitzhugh. When Fitzhugh moved from Washington County, Maryland (a slave holding state), to Genessee County, New York (a free state), he sold James and Joseph for $980 (February 10, 1818). Kate, a mixed race enslaved woman about 18 years old and described as sound and healthy, was sold by her enslaver, Arnold Hanenhamp of Hagenstown, Maryland, for $400 (February 10, 1818).</p> <p>This folder also includes letters to John Wesley Hunt of Lexington, Kentucky; Hunt's receipts for stabling horses and legal services from Thomas Bodley; and an inventory list of lands purchased in Huntsville, Kentucky. Letters concern drafts and notes, documents for a lawsuit, hemp and tobacco business, ginseng, stocks, and other business matters. </p> </scopecontent> </c>
