Nearly all of the correspondence is addressed to Calvin Cogswell Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, or to both Morgan and his business partner, Henry P. McGrath. Correspondence to Morgan from McGrath discusses his hemp sales in New York and instructions for moving a horse and buying another. Correspondence from C.C. Morgan's younger brother, Richard Curd Morgan, also discusses hemp sales along with giving updates on family news. Charlton Morgan, another younger brother, wrote C.C. Morgan several times asking for money and complained of unfairness in the family to R.C. Morgan after being denied.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
