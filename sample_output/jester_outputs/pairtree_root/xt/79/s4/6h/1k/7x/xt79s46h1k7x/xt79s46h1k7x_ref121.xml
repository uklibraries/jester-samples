Hunt for $1230.30 and $2,084.53. Several letters are cover letters for accounts and money or discuss debts and acquiring money. Other letters from business associates discuss property rentals and purchases, orders shipped to Hunt, a run on the Bank of the U.S. in Philadelphia, rates of exchange, difficulties with one of Hunt's tenants, and legal issues. Letters from John Wesley Hunt's daughters, Mary Hanna and Ann Reynolds, discuss their extended stay in New Orleans, Louisiana, with their husbands, John Hanna and William B. Reynolds. Another letter from Hunt's daughter, Theodosia Strother, asks for his assistance in settling the estate and leasing her property in the wake of her husband's death three months prior (February 25, 1841).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
