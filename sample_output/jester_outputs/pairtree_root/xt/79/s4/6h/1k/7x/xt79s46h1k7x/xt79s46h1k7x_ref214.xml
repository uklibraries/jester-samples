The bills and receipts were all for goods and services purchased by Mrs. Ellen Key Howard and her daughter, Miss Ellen "Nellie" Key Howard Morgan, from businesses in Lexington, Kentucky and the checks were written by Ellen and Nellie Morgan to pay for these expenses. They also received monthly gas, water, and telephone bills for their shared home and leased the ground floor to a tenant. A letter to John Hunt Morgan requests a painting of General John Hunt Morgan and a photo of his old house in Lexington, Kentucky, for P.W. Miller as a surprise for his wife, Morgan's cousin (October 29, 1914). A postcard addressed to Mrs. Ellen Key Morgan advertises an Elaborate Centenniel in Boston, Massachusetts, celebrating the bombardment of Fort McHenry and Francis Scott Key's writing of the Star Spangled Banner.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
