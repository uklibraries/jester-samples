Morgan and her cousin, John Hunt Morgan; receipts and bills for purchases made by Nellie K.H. Morgan in Lexington, Kentucky; a court document stating that the land owned by Morgan heirs in Menifee County, Kentucky, had been condemned and the United States Government paid the amount awarded as compensation; and a newspaper clipping about a romance between Confederate Colonel Morgan and a beautiful woman during the Civil War. Several of the letters are either to or from John Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, regarding his loan payments and overdue pledges with various loan companies as well as his attempts to sell valuable possessions such as gold pieces, antique furniture, books and papers by John Keats, and stamps. A letter from Lorine Letcher Butler of New York City to Nellie K.H. Morgan asks for clarification on a few points about Confederate General John Hunt Morgan for a biography she is publishing soon (January 27, 1937). A letter from Dr. Thomas Hunt Morgan at the California Institute of Technology to his sister, Nellie K.H. Morgan, confirms the closing of their last lawsuit related to the Morgan heirs' land in Menifee County, Kentucky, after several years (April 26, 1937).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
