The majority of the letters written to Charlton Hunt Morgan Jr. and his father regard their unsuccessful attempts to find him a job in Lexington, Kentucky, as he was not enjoying life in St. Louis, Missouri. Some letters to Charlton H. Morgan Sr. discuss his nephew, Calvin Cogswell Morgan III's, continued battle with malaria. A letter to Charlton H. Morgan from his sister, Henrietta Duke, advises him not to testify against Madeline Pollard in the famous Pollard-Breckinridge case and encloses a newspaper clipping about the matter (February 25, 1894).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
