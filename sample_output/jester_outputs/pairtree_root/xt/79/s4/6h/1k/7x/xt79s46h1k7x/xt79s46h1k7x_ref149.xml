George informing Calvin Cogswell Morgan that George has hired persons enslaved by Morgan to Keene Richard (May 14, 1860). The majority of the letters are written to Calvin Cogswell Morgan and/or John Hunt Morgan (addressed to C.C. Morgan and Co.) regarding wool sales and financial matters related to their business. A letter from C.H. Morgan in Missina, Sicily, to Calvin C. Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, describes the revolution occurring at the time including the torture and execution of political prisoners and the arrival of Garabaldi with his troops (May 19, 1860). Two letters to Calvin C. Morgan advise him as to political bets being placed on the presidential candidates. There are also three letters between Henrietta Morgan and her brother-in-law, John H. Hanna.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
