Hunt, and an agreement stating that John W. Hunt will pave and pay for several footways on Buckner Thruston's property. Pleasant, an enslaved Black boy about 11 years old, and Charlotte, an enslaved Black girl about 9 years old, were delivered to their enslaver John Wesley Hunt of Lexington, Kentucky, in March of 1802 for 120 pounds, the paperwork for which was signed on August 30, 1805. Both land grants were given to the trustees of Fleming Academy on July 3, 1805, for a school in Christian County, Kentucky; one was for 480 acres and the other for 636 acres. The letters contain details of Hunt's hemp and tobacco sales; the poor economy in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Hunt does a significant amount of trading; and letters from Ralph Phillips, Samuel Wells, William P. Anderson, and Peter Lott discuss the breeding and potential sales of their stallions Highlander, Highflyer, Blossom, Royalist, and Paymaster.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
