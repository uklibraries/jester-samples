Morgan's home in Lexington, Kentucky; and checks written by Nellie K.H. Morgan. The eight powers of attorney are signed by various Morgan heirs living outside of Kentucky giving power to either Julia Duke Henning [Louisville, KY], Nellie K.H. Morgan [Lexington, KY], or Christine Applegate [Lexington, KY] in the sale of the land in Menifee County, KY, to the United States Government. Much of the correspondence documents John Hunt Morgan's attempts to sell various pieces of artwork, rare books, and valuable furniture both directly and through his cousin, Nellie K.H. Morgan, due to his poor financial situation.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
