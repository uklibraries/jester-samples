Clarke in Lexington, Kentucky; a report of the Eastern Kentucky Oil Company, headed by John Hunt Morgan, to the stockholders; notes in which John Hunt Morgan and J.H. March promise to pay back a loan; notes written by Miss Caswell for Judge Gourley regarding the Henrietta Hunt Morgan heirs for a property lawsuit; and a pamphlet written entirely in French from the funeral of Sister Elizabeth. Many of the letters are written by Lilian Vaughan Morgan to her mother-in-law, Mrs. Ellen Key Morgan, discussing her new baby boy, Howard, and her husband, Thomas Morgan's, work at Columbia University. A letter written by John Hunt Morgan, president of the Eastern Kentucky Oil Company in Lexington, Kentucky, encloses the company account statement and discloses their bad luck in the first development which led to the company going broke (August 1, 1906).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
