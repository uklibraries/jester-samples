Sherman's announcement to the troops in Charlotte, North Carolina, concerning a truce pending ratification of surrender. Several letters are addressed to Henrietta Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, from her sons discussing their lives in Union prisons and their hopes of Charlton and Richard Curd Morgan being exchanged or paroled. Edward Lloyd Howard wrote to his mother, Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard, and Alice Howard discussing his being paroled after the Confederate Army surrendered. E.L. Howard attempted to go home to Baltimore, Maryland, but was forbidden to travel past Fort Monroe, Virginia, after he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the United States.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
