Sayre's stocks and a note to Dr. Robert Pearson Hunt for $5,262.50. Many of the letters to John W. Hunt from business associates discuss money matters such as bonds, debt repayment, banking, account statements, checks, and rates of exchange. Other letters discuss business transactions, crime in the Eastern Kentucky Lunatic Asylum, influenza in Lexington, the upcoming election for the directors of the Fireman's Insurance Company, an unsatisfactory tenant renting Hunt's land, and lard sales. A letter from Francis Scott Key informs Hunt that he has not been able to get information on William Swartout but has enlisted a friend to investigate further (September 3, 1841).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
