Morgan to become a member of the Order of the Descendants of Colonial Governors by right of descent from Governor Edward Lloyd II. The syllabus is a printed outline of a lecture titled "Darwin's Influence on Zoology" by Thomas Hunt Morgan, a professor of experimental zoology at Columbia University, with a handwritten note at the top written by Morgan's wife, Lilian Vaughan Morgan, saying how successful and crowded it was (February 26, 1909). Lilian V. Morgan of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, wrote several letters to her mother-in-law, Ellen Howard Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, discussing her young children. There are numerous letters between John Hunt Morgan and George W. Reffeitt, the surveyor of Menifee County, Kentucky, discussing property taxes and an ongoing lawsuit over land.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
