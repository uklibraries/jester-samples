Several letters are addressed to Calvin Cogswell Morgan or to both Calvin C. Morgan and John Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, discussing financial matters and the wool business. A letter to C.C. Morgan from J.C. Hawkings claims the enslaved persons on the New Uncle Sam are well "with the exception of a few grumblers" (March 19, 1861), however, a letter from Lunsford P. Yandell Junior says he has examined the men on the steamer and suggests they be removed at once due to their poor health (April 5, 1861). Thomas Morgan wrote several letters to his mother, Henrietta Morgan, discussing his high grades in school, his belief that Kentucky should join the Confederacy, and his desire to hang President Lincoln in effigy.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
