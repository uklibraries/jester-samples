Hanna, and a tax receipt. A note from Calvin C. Morgan promises to pay $1000 if Matilda and her children, Betsey and Sam, are sold by their enslavers Robert and Sarah Nelson of Caroline County, Virginia, to John Wesley Hunt of Lexington, Kentucky (November 3, 1835). The majority of the letters are addressed to John Wesley Hunt. In a letter dated October 9, Hunt's son, Abram D. Hunt, mentioned being nervous about his mother's illness but commented that he heard she was out of danger. Following letters from friends on October 27 and November 2 express condolences on Catherine Hunt's passing.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
