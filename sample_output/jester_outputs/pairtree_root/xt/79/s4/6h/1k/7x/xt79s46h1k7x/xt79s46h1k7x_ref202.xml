The majority of the letters were composed by Virginia Jeffrey Morgan or John Hunt Morgan and addressed to family members back home giving details of their extended honeymoon traveling across Europe following their wedding in June. All but one of the receipts and bills in this folder document the couple's purchases and hotel stays in Europe over the course of several months.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
