Pinafore" in Paris, Kentucky. The majority of the correspondence pieces are written to members of the Hunt-Morgan family. Several letters plan and discuss a trip to Lexington, Virginia, to witness the unveiling of Stonewall Jackson's statue. A letter from James S. Barton Key of Arthur, Tennessee, to Charlton Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, gives condolences on the death of Barton's cousin and Morgan's mother, Henrietta Hunt Morgan (September 8, 1891).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
