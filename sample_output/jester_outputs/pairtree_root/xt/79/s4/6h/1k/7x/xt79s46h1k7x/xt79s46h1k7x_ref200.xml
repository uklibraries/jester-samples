All of the correspondence addressed to John Hunt Morgan was written by his lawyer, Thomas W. Shackleford of West Superior, Wisconsin, regarding their fight in what he believed was an increasingly futile property case against the Scott family. Letters written to Ellen "Nellie" K.H. Morgan give news of friends and family and confirm her return to Bryn Mawr College following her semesters off due to illness.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
