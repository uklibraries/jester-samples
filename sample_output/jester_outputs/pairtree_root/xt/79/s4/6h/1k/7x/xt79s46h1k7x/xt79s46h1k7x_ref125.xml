Hunt for $1000 and $1400 and a note of exchange to John Wesley Hunt for $2791.87. Most of the letters from business associates discuss financial matters such as debt collection, banking, notes, checks sent, and the purchase and shipment of sugar crop. A letter from John White on March 29, 1843, asks Hunt to block any successor to the presidency of the Lexington branch of the Northern Bank should it become vacant before he arrives in Lexington, and a subsequent letter on April 10 offers the name of Colonel P.W. White as successor for the now vacant presidency. Letters from Hunt's son, Thomas Hart Hunt, describe a sawmill he inspected for possible purchase and comment on prices of sugar and hemp. A letter from John W. Hunt's daughter, Theodosia Strother, details her shock at hearing of the devastation of his farm by the last hurricane (June 22, 1843).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
