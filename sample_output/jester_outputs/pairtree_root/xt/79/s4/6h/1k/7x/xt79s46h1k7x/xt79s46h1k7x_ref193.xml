The majority of the correspondence consists of letters written by Carrie Beale Morgan to her son, John Hunt Morgan. Early letters between the two discussed her trip to Alum Springs, Kentucky, and in later correspondence she sent newspapers and personal news from home in Lexington, Kentucky, while he was away.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
