          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Formed in Kentucky in 1977 after a musical celebration at the International Women's Year Conference in Lexington, the Reel World String Band's original lineup featured Sue Massek on banjo and guitar, Karen Jones on fiddle, Sharon Ruble on bass, Belle Jackson on guitar, and Bev Futrell on mandolin, guitar, and harmonica. </p><p>The band's repertoire consists of a combination of traditional Appalachian songs and original songs that incorporate old-time music with influences from blues, jazz, and country. They draw inspiration from other musicians, including Florence Reece, Sara Ogan Gunning, and Lily May Ledford. With a dual focus on the preservation of Appalachian traditions and on advocacy for social justice causes, the Reel World String Band has a history of playing diverse venues.  In addition to performing on concert stages and at folk festivals, the band has performed at conferences in support of activist endeavors to improve rights for women and the working class as well as at rallies and picket lines in protest of coal mining practices. The band has also led workshops on a variety of topics, including banjo and fiddle styles, the history of women in traditional music, songs of labor and environmental struggle, and old-time Appalachian dancing, traditional instruments, and musical techniques. </p><p>Current Reel World String Band members include original members Sue Massek, Bev Futrell, Karen Jones, and Sharon Ruble, who rejoined the band in 1995. Pianist Elise Melrood, who performed intermittently with the band and contributed to multiple Reel World albums, joined the band officially in 1995.</p>
