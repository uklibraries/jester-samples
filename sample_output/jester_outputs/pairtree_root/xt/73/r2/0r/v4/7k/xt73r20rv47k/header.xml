Notable items include an 1865 letter to General Burbridge marked confidential criticizing General James S. Brisbin, claiming he <emph render="doublequote">recognized in an official act the power of a master over slaves</emph> by arresting Black men working for the army and having them work under a written contract benefitting the enslaver. Another 1865 letter and accompanying affidavits describe alleged election interference by J.J. Craddock during the 1864 election in Franklin County, Kentucky. </p><p>Additionally, the collection contains some assorted correspondence as well as legal and financial documents for the Perry and Gex families of Kentucky in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
