      <p>The University of Kentucky is the flagship, land-grant university for the Commonwealth of Kentucky located in Lexington, Kentucky. It was established by an Act of the Legislature in 1865 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky University (now Transylvania University). In 1878, the Legislature split A&amp;M College from Kentucky University, and it became State College and began developing into a university. In 1908, the Legislature changed the name from State College to State University. In 1916, the Legislature again changed the name from State University to University of Kentucky.</p>

        <p>George Roberts was head of the Department of Agronomy in the College of Agriculture.  President Frank McVey asked him to write a history of the University of Kentucky by rewriting an existing manuscript history.  In his foreword, Roberts indicates that a large part of this history is taken from the biography of President James K. Patterson by Mabel Hardy Pollitt.  Correspondence from Frank McVey to Roberts and from Roberts to Ezra Gillis (1935 January-May) is included in the bound volume.</p>
