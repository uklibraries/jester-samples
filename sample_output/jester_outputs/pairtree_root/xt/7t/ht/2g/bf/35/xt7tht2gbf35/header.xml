          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Ben Reeves Artifacts and Memorabilia Collection on University of Kentucky Athletics (1962-2013, undated; 9 cubic feet; 12 boxes and 1 tube) comprises primarily three-dimensional objects, photograph albums, and videocassette tapes documenting the play, publicity, and marketing of the individual athletes, games, and tournaments of the University of Kentucky football and men's basketball teams from the mid-20th century through the early 21st century. The objects include banners; basketballs; bumper stickers; buttons; cups, flyers; game tickets; glasses, and mugs; lighters; plaques; player cards; and scorecards.  The scrapbooks and photograph albums contain newspaper clippings and head and action shots for specific men's basketball players, including Thomas Miller Kron (1962-1965), Jimmy Dan Conner (in high school, 1970-1974, and in college, 1974-1975), Mike Phillips (1974-1975), and Jim Master (1983-1984); as well as head, action, and Reeve's own snapshots of basketball teams, games, and tournaments, especially the 1974-1975 team, the 1983 Kentucky-University of Louisville game, and the 1987 Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament in Atlanta, Georgia.  There are also some Kentucky high school boy's basketball teams and games represented.  The videocassettes comprise commercially produced documentaries, celebrations, and marketing pieces for UK football and men's basketball, as well as for a few Kentucky high school football and boy's basketball teams and tournaments.  There are also photographs of teams, individual players, and snapshots of Rupp Arena (Lexington, Ky.); newspaper clippings; game programs; and correspondence.  The publications received with the collection have been interfiled into the Special Collections Research Center's athletic publications collection (2008ua025).</p>
