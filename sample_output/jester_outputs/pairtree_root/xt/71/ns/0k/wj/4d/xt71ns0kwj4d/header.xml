      <p>Lillie D. Chaffin was born February 1, 1925, at Varney, Kentucky, to Kenis and Fairybelle Dorton. Lillie began school at age four and graduated eighth grade at twelve. Her family could not afford to send her to high school, but with the school administration's assistance she was able to attend Johns Creek High School in Pikeville. Lillie dropped out of high school to marry Thomas Chaffin in 1942 but resumed her education three years later. After graduating as valedictorian of her class in 1947, Lillie completed her bachelor's degree at Pikeville College. She then began a career in the public school system and devoted 28 years as a teacher and librarian in Kentucky public schools. Lillie moved to Florida in 1981 following the death of her husband, Thomas. There, she met and married Vernon O. Kash, who died in 1985. After being diagnosed with cancer, Lillie joined her son, Thomas, in West Virginia, and died there in October 1993.  </p><p>Early in her teaching career, Lillie began writing poetry and children's stories. Her poetry was featured in journals and anthologies nationwide and in 1963, she published her first children's book, titled <title render="italic">A Garden is Good</title>. In 1967, her poetry anthology <title render="italic">A Stone for Sisyphus</title> earned an award from the International Poetry Society. In 1969, her book <title render="italic">Bear Wheather</title> was named one of the best juvenile books of the year by the New York Times. In 1971, <title render="italic">John Henry McCoy</title> was awarded the annual Best Book for Young Readers Award from the Child Study Association of America. In 1974, her book <title render="italic">Eighth Day Thirteenth Moon</title> was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. In 1991, she co-edited <title render="italic">God's Plenty: Modern Kentucky Writers</title>, a collection of short fiction, poetry and essays by Kentucky authors.  </p><p>Throughout her writing career, Lillie authored seventeen books of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction for children and adults. She went on to earn a master's degree from Eastern Kentucky University and was named Teacher of the Year and Distinguished alumnus by the university. She was also awarded honorary Doctorate of Letters degrees from both EKU and Pikeville College. In 1996, Morehead State University began the Thomas and Lille D. Chaffin Award, which recognizes outstanding Appalachian authors. Notable recipients of the award include George Ella Lyon, Michael McFee, Michael Chitwood, and James R. Riley. </p><p>Sources:  </p><p>https://pikecountykyhistoricalsociety.com/lillie-d-chaffin/ </p><p>https://kentuckyoralhistory.org/ark:/16417/xt74qr4nnt8p </p>
