<c level="series" id="ref3907"> <did> <unittitle> Interior Department Series</unittitle> </did> <scopecontent> <p>Boxes 287-359</p> <p>Morton served as Secretary of the Interior under both President Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford. The boxes in this series are divided into four subseries. Except for the Subject Files subseries, the arrangement is basically chronological with folders arranged alphabetically within the years. The Subject Files integrate several groups as shipped from Washington, D.C. The largest group was labeled "Subject and Individuals" and was boxed alphabetically. "Menlo Park" indicates that the file was in a group generated during Morton's cancer treatment in Menlo Park, California, February 19 - April 13, 1973. "1971 Alphabetical File" indicates that the material was from a box so-labeled. Two other miscellaneous subject boxes were also included but are not indicated due to lack of coherence. Bulky files were split into #1, #2, etc. there is generally no rationale behind the division except to divide the material as it stood in the original files and make it more physically manageable. Folders are also numbered if there were multiple folders with the same title but no distinction as to sub-category. Several files labeled "Republican National Committee" were originally, obviously erroneously, included in the material. "Personal File" indicates that the material had been kept at Morton's Easton, Maryland home. Names are simply transferred from the original folder label. In the case of inconsistency, the more formal name was used.</p> <p>Subseries: Correspondence Files, Hitt and Hughes Files, Subject Files, Travel Files, White House Files</p> </scopecontent> <c level="subseries" id="ref3908"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4040"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4134"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4145"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4148"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4156"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4160"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4163"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4167"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4169"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4171"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4174"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4182"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4192"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4200"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4204"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4209"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4214"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4216"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4219"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4221"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4225"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4233"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4236"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4245"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4247"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref4695"/> <c level="subseries" id="ref5067"/> </c>
