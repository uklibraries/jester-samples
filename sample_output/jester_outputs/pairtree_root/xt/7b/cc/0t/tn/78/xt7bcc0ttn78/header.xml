          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Henrietta Alice McCrea was born into a wealthy Chicago family in 1888. She was taken to Paris, France, at an early age and spoke French as her native tongue. She was married twice: first to the landscape painter Willard Lloyd Metcalf (1858-1925) and for a short time to the author Marcus Aurelius Goodrich (1897-1991). Both marriages ended in divorce, but she reverted to Metcalf's name for the rest of her life. She and Willard Metcalf had two children, Addison and Rosalind. Additionally, in 1952, she took in a boy named Jacobus Arnoldus who inherited a portion of her estate.</p><p>She was an avid fan of theater and actors and amassed a large collection of autographed photographs and other memorabilia. Metcalf also translated French works into English: Alexandre Dumas' play <title render="italic">Camille</title> and Anatole France's story <title render="italic">Our Lady's Juggler</title>.</p><p>In 1928 she began an affair with Thelma Wood, the lover of the novelist Djuna Barnes. This prompted Barnes to satirize Metcalf in her novel, <title render="italic">Nightwood</title>. Metcalf appears as the character Jenny Petherbridge. Metcalf and Wood's relationship lasted until 1943, and they did not part on the best of terms.</p><p>Metcalf died in 1981. Addison Metcalf went on to found The Henrietta Alice Metcalf Memorial Scholarship at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts in his mother's honor due to her life time love of the theater. Addison McCrea Metcalf, 1914-1983, amassed a large collection of materials related to Gertrude Stein and during he was considered the foremost expert of Gerrtrude Stein works. </p><p>Note: Metcalf often spelled her first name in the French style: Henriette. Henrietta Alice Metcalf, Henriette Alice Metcalf, Henriette McCrea Metcalf, Henrietta McCrea Metcalf, Henrietta Metcalf, and Henriette Metcalf are all forms used during her lifetime and subsequently.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>McCrea-Metcalf, New York Times, page 13, 1910 Dec 13, Newspapers.com, accessed 2022 May 24.

      <p>The Henrietta Metcalf Theatre Collection (dated 1940-1977, undated; 6.3 cubic feet; 15 boxes) primarily comprises ephemera, magazine and newspaper clippings, papers, and scrapbooks that document early twentieth century theatre performers and other celebrities in the United States and Europe collected by avid fan Henriette Alice McCrae Metcalf. The majority of the collection includes scrapbooks and theatre record volumes created and designed by Metcalf with many clippings and cut-outs of actresses from magazines. Some of the photos, playbills, programmes are signed by the performers. The papers and scrapbooks also contain caricatures, artworks, and reviews related to theatre. A portion of the collection contains clippings, programmes, and realia about or from Sarah Bernhardt, the acclaimed French stage actress. Although not a performer, the collection includes many articles and publications related to the twice elected Prime Minister of England, Winston Churchill. In addition to some letters, notes, publications, are diaries and journals written by Metcalf in the collection. Also included are letters and a manuscript saved by Henriette's son, Addison McCrae-Metcalf.</p>

        <p>Henrietta Alice McCrea was a frequent theatregoer, often going several times a week, sometimes twice in a day, even when at school, and often seeing the same play or entertainment several times. She often watched performances from the front row or a box seat, not only the most expensive seats, but those closest to the actors. 
    Like many followers of the theatre in her time, and certainly like many financially-comfortable young women of her era, McCrea kept a record of what she saw in a special album designed to hold the cast list of each event, accompanied by printed prompts to note the date, the theatre, her companions, and her reactions to the play. As mirrored in her journals, her strongest reactions were usually reserved for female stars and leading ladies. 
    Throughout her life, she saved programs as souvenirs of her theatre experiences. After her marriages, Mrs. Metcalf may have served as drama editor for Vanity Fair (documentation needed), but she turned her hand early to dramatic criticism, and several of her typewritten reviews are inserted in the Theatre Records; the history of their submission and publication is uncertain. 
    In the years covered in her Theatre Records, H.M. attended the principal theatres in Chicago (her hometown), New York (on visits), and Washington, D. C., (while at school, often in the company of her French-speaking teachers). She also attended theatres in Richmond, VA, and in Portland, OR, while visiting friends there. She also haunted the theatres of Paris and in Germany.
    In general, this guide to H.M.'s theatre records lists stars with above title billing first, then the title, date of attendance, venue, and notes of interest, including Henriette Metcalf's companion, and notable cast members, playwrights, directors, as well as accompanying ephemera, including notation of those productions reviewed by <title render="doublequote">H. A. M.</title></p>
        <p>In ten volumes, not including the Theatre Records series.
    Eight volumes, covering American, French, and European theatre and opera personalities and productions, roughly 1903-1909. Some volumes were indexed by Henrietta McCrae. Contents include programs, reviews, postcards, and clipped portrait and production photographs from magazines and newspapers of the time. Limited commentary and identification by HM.</p>
        <p>One volume dedicated to actress Sarah Bernhardt. </p>
        <p>Two volumes, from the early 1930s, one dedicated mostly to American film stars, including Katherine Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West, and others. A second dedicated to stage and personalities in the news. </p>
