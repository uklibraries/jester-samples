    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Henrietta Alice McCrea was born into a wealthy Chicago family in 1888. She was taken to Paris, France, at an early age and spoke French as her native tongue. She was married twice: first to the landscape painter Willard Lloyd Metcalf (1858-1925) and for a short time to the author Marcus Aurelius Goodrich (1897-1991). Both marriages ended in divorce, but she reverted to Metcalf's name for the rest of her life. She and Willard Metcalf had two children, Addison and Rosalind. Additionally, in 1952, she took in a boy named Jacobus Arnoldus who inherited a portion of her estate.</p><p>She was an avid fan of theater and actors and amassed a large collection of autographed photographs and other memorabilia. Metcalf also translated French works into English: Alexandre Dumas' play <title render="italic">Camille</title> and Anatole France's story <title render="italic">Our Lady's Juggler</title>.</p><p>In 1928 she began an affair with Thelma Wood, the lover of the novelist Djuna Barnes. This prompted Barnes to satirize Metcalf in her novel, <title render="italic">Nightwood</title>. Metcalf appears as the character Jenny Petherbridge. Metcalf and Wood's relationship lasted until 1943, and they did not part on the best of terms.</p><p>Metcalf died in 1981. Addison Metcalf went on to found The Henrietta Alice Metcalf Memorial Scholarship at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts in his mother's honor due to her life time love of the theater. Addison McCrea Metcalf, 1914-1983, amassed a large collection of materials related to Gertrude Stein and during he was considered the foremost expert of Gerrtrude Stein works. </p><p>Note: Metcalf often spelled her first name in the French style: Henriette. Henrietta Alice Metcalf, Henriette Alice Metcalf, Henriette McCrea Metcalf, Henrietta McCrea Metcalf, Henrietta Metcalf, and Henriette Metcalf are all forms used during her lifetime and subsequently.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>McCrea-Metcalf, New York Times, page 13, 1910 Dec 13, Newspapers.com, accessed 2022 May 24.

<p>The Henrietta Metcalf Theatre Collection (dated 1940-1977, undated; 6.3 cubic feet; 15 boxes) primarily comprises ephemera, magazine and newspaper clippings, papers, and scrapbooks that document early twentieth century theatre performers and other celebrities in the United States and Europe collected by avid fan Henriette Alice McCrae Metcalf. The majority of the collection includes scrapbooks and theatre record volumes created and designed by Metcalf with many clippings and cut-outs of actresses from magazines. Some of the photos, playbills, programmes are signed by the performers. The papers and scrapbooks also contain caricatures, artworks, and reviews related to theatre. A portion of the collection contains clippings, programmes, and realia about or from Sarah Bernhardt, the acclaimed French stage actress. Although not a performer, the collection includes many articles and publications related to the twice elected Prime Minister of England, Winston Churchill. In addition to some letters, notes, publications, are diaries and journals written by Metcalf in the collection. Also included are letters and a manuscript saved by Henriette's son, Addison McCrae-Metcalf.</p>  </scopecontent>

Henriette Metcalf used this volume as a diary with mostly short entries, detailing the day-to-day events in the Metcalf household. Henriette Metcalf plays poker, attends the theatre, opera, moving pictures, and concerts, worries when her children Rosalind and Addison are ill, and notes the departures and returns of her husband, artist Willard Metcalf. </p><p>Henriette Metcalf appears to have worked at this time in assisting placement of orphaned or abandoned children; she details the arrival and placement of each child, noting the disposition of each child, and often mentioning the attachment of her own children to these transient guests. Transactions involving the placement of children often seem to occur at Sherry's Restaurant. Odd references to operation of postgraduate, suggesting abortion or hysterectomy. </p><p>Metcalf's work with children was through the Speedwell Society, founded in Morristown, with a branch in Yonkers. The Speedwell Society was dedicated to placing orphaned or abandoned children in homes, no institutions, and in 1919, was responding to the increased number of orphans following the recent epidemic of influenza. Yvonne Gall's benefit concert of March 28, 1919, was organized by Mrs. Henry Addison Alexander. Volunteers with the Speedwell included Mrs. Simeon B. Chapin, Mrs. Brayton Ives, Mrs. Arthur F. Mason, Mrs. James A. Burden, Mrs. Walter Lambert, Mrs. William H. Burr, Miss Dorothy Donnelly, Mrs. Frank S. Fielder, Mrs. Henry Dwight Chapin, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Mrs. Stephen S. Wise, Mrs. William H. Wadham, and Mrs. John E. Tucker. Other parties, listed as "interested," included, Mrs. Charles B. Alexander, Mrs. Benjamin Brewster, Miss Annie B. Jeanings?, Mrs. Otto H. Kahn, Mrs. William V. S. Thorne, Mrs. Joseph Pulitzer, Mrs. Frances Ives, Mrs. John A. Hartwell, Mrs. Harry Harkness Flagler, Mrs. Willard Metcalf, Mrs. Walter Graeme Ladd, Mrs. John O. H. Pitney, Mrs. W. W Lawrence. See New York Herald, March 23, 1919, 66.</p><p>Henry Dwight Chapin (1857-1942), founder of the Speedwell Society, for placement of children in foster homes, avoiding the dangers of institutions. 
Attending physician at the New York Post-graduate Medical School and Hospital. Chapin married Alice Delafield (d. 1964) of Chicago in 1907, See Chicago Tribune, May 26 1907, 55.</p><p>

Of course such abrupt changes in a girl's life have not had the very best effect on her disposition and tend to give her a cynical and exaggerated opinion of the ills of this world.</title></p><p>Mother was <title render="italic">very very beautiful</title>, married at seventeen, mother of boy and girl, divorced, remarried to <title render="italic">a kind handsome man [New Yorker?] to whom I was devoted.</title> Courts gave custody of both children to the mother but <title render="italic">for some reason</title> she gave up the son, ___and <title render="italic">kept me. At the tender age of six months I was taken abroad and there was practically brought up, coming to America frequently, but always returning to travel somewhere on the Continent. Till I was seven I spoke but French and queer English. I must say this as no one will ever see these papers and after all its [sic] past now I was a most attractive child of whom Mamma was very proud and extremely ambitious to have grow up clever and intelligent.</title> </p><p>Governess: Leónie? studied language and music

My aunt a vain frivolous woman spoiled and neglected us in turn, totally disregarding that we were children (Mildred was fourteen and I was ten) and allowing us to hear and know things generally kept from youngsters.

Father's good looks and attractive ways speedily won my heart and though he teased me much I loved him dearly. I was prejudiced agains my father but his kindness won me over. Mrs. McCrea however failed to gain my affection. I would have been willing, may even been glad to have welcomed her as a good friend but her reception though doubtless intended to be kindly was cold, feelingless, and unresponsive. I lived with her a violet [?] made bearable by Mrs. Eckmay's (the housekeeper's) goodness to me.</title> </p><p>Four years at a French school, Chevy Chase School, in Washington, <title render="italic">happy days</title>, summers at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin?, and with visits to New York.

Stayed with Mrs. Fisk, <title render="italic">a charming woman who was as good as a mother to me.</title> and met Genevieve Hall, a girl from Ridgeway PA, </p><p><title render="italic">I find myself fifteen [written over earlier record] and a woman of some ambition to do something in the world but I feel my lack of concentration, my incapability to apply myself assiduously to one thing. I am restless as my Mother was and am only happy when some new project is astir—when excitement is in store. At times I am positively morbid and discouraged when I think and fully realize my own utter[?] "littleness" and am spured [sic] on to do something that may gain me a prominent place and give me a name in the work of letters. I aspire to write—that is the secret in a nut-shell. These pages are not examples of what I can write for they are to be merely receptacles of my moods, emotions, and passions should I harbor any; at present I am "heart-whole," and fancy free. So far my most ardent affections have pivoted and vacillated around fair women—not necessarily beautifulness but fascinating ones to me. I say vacillated for to be truthful I am fickle and if my ideal is found to very much as any other mortal I generally place my affections elsewhere.</title> (Page 10)</p><p><title render="italic">I have one passionate fondness and that is beauty—"anything can be forgiven a beautiful woman" is my credo—"Fascination" I believe to be the essential and foremost property in the world…I have one fervent wish namely that no matter how old, bitter, or cynical I grow that I may always retain the certainty that no woman is thoroughly bad. It may seem a bold assertion from the pen of a supposedly unsophisticated girl but these are my unusual thoughts that none shall ever read, so the [12]criticism of these words will be made by my older more mature most experienced self and I hope wiser self in years to come. But my observations of woman have driven me to rather astoundingly to [sic?] the primly properly correct class of people…Having associated with two distinct different classes of women I am honest in saying I have judged both.</title> </p><p>Mother's friends were part of the <title render="italic">Smart Set</title> <title render="italic">not averse to [13] mild drinking or smoking and did not fear the world's censure should they be seen with one whose reputation bore no close investigation. They were women of the World with ordinary faults of womankind, the same love of flattery and adulation, probably taking the same pleasure in gossip but though their ways and modes of living should get [?] frivolity and contempt for conventionality—to the outside world I firmly believe that no better woman ever existed. Lend a helping hand to the fallen one and [14] women who "having suffered" know of sympathy. 
Then there is the rich embittered woman whose dollars cannot restore her youth, and who sullenly banished all attractive woman from about her, retaining merely a group of sponges who patiently dance attendance in hopes of (figuratively speaking) scraps [15] from the banquet table… subjugation to the will of an other merely for the sake of social position is inconceivable for the mind of an independent person.</title></p><p>July 16, 1905

going several times a week, sometimes twice in a day, even when at school, and often seeing the same play or entertainment several times. She often watched performances from the front row or a box seat, not only the most expensive seats, but those closest to the actors. 
Like many followers of the theatre in her time, and certainly like many financially-comfortable young women of her era, McCrea kept a record of what she saw in a special album designed to hold the cast list of each event, accompanied by printed prompts to note the date, the theatre, her companions, and her reactions to the play. As mirrored in her journals, her strongest reactions were usually reserved for female stars and leading ladies. 
Throughout her life, she saved programs as souvenirs of her theatre experiences. After her marriages, Mrs. Metcalf may have served as drama editor for Vanity Fair (documentation needed), but she turned her hand early to dramatic criticism, and several of her typewritten reviews are inserted in the Theatre Records; the history of their submission and publication is uncertain. 
In the years covered in her Theatre Records, H.M. attended the principal theatres in Chicago (her hometown), New York (on visits), and Washington, D. C., (while at school, often in the company of her French-speaking teachers). She also attended theatres in Richmond, VA, and in Portland, OR, while visiting friends there. She also haunted the theatres of Paris and in Germany.
In general, this guide to H.M.'s theatre records lists stars with above title billing first, then the title, date of attendance, venue, and notes of interest, including Henriette Metcalf's companion, and notable cast members, playwrights, directors, as well as accompanying ephemera, including notation of those productions reviewed by <title render="doublequote">H.
