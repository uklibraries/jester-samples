          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Governor of Kentucky and United States Senator, John White Stevenson was born in Richmond, Virginia. He read law in Virginia and, on the advice of James Madison, moved west to open his practice. After living in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Stevenson moved to Covington, Kentucky in 1841. Four years later he was elected to the Kentucky state legislature as a representative from Kenton County. He was a member of the 1849 state constitutional convention and further familiarized himself with the state's laws by coauthoring with James Harlan, <title render="italic">Code of Practice in Civil and Criminal Cases</title>. After serving as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1848, 1852, 1861, he served in the House of Representatives (1857-1861). A strong Confederate sympathizer, Stevenson returned to politics after the Civil War, with his election to the lieutenant governorship of Kentucky in 1867. Upon the death of Governor John LaRue Helm, Stevenson was elevated to the governorship. He failed to serve the full term, however, for he defeated Senator Thomas McCreery and won a seat in the United States Senate in 1871. At the end of his term in 1877 he returned to his law practice in Covington and to teaching criminal law and contracts in the Cincinnati law school. He served as chairman of the Democratic National Convention in 1880, and in 1884 was elected president of the American Bar Association.</p>

      <p>The John W. Stevenson papers (dated 1868-1885; 2.25 cubic feet; 5 boxes) consist of diaries, letter books, receipts, and a will, documenting the life and career of Kentucky lawyer and politician John W. Stevenson. Stevenson's diaries (9 volumes) document daily life and contemporary political issues. The letter books (6 volumes) cover 1877-1884 and document Kentucky politics and the affairs of the Episcopal church. Many of the letters relate to the 1876 Presidential election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden; Stevenson's visit to Louisiana as one of the <emph render="doublequote">visiting statesmen</emph> who went to examine the election returns; discussions of Hayes term as President; and the nomination of the Democratic candidate.</p>
