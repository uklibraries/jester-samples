      <p>Wendell Hampton Ford (September 8, 1924 – January 22, 2015) was born in Daviess County, Kentucky to Ernest M. and Irene Woolfork Ford. He attended the University of Kentucky from 1942 to 1943, leaving in 1944 to enlist in the army for service in World War II. He married Jean Neel on September 18, 1943 and they had two children – Shirley and Steven. After an honorable discharge in 1946, Ford returned home and graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance in 1947 to work with his father in the family insurance business. In 1949 he enlisted in the Kentucky Army National Guard serving actively until 1956 when he transferred to the inactive guard and then was discharged in 1962. Ford was active in civic affairs early on; he was the first Kentuckian president of the Jaycees in 1954, youth chairman of Bert T. Combs' gubernatorial campaign in 1959, and then Combs' executive assistant from 1959 to 1963. </p><p>In 1965 Ford ran as a Democrat for the Kentucky State Senate after being asked to by then Governor Ned Breathitt, beating Casper Gardner by a narrow margin to represent the Eighth District which included Daviess and Hancock counties. In 1967 Ford decided to independently run for Lieutenant Governor, winning the primary by another narrow margin, and won the general election while the Democratic nominee for governor, Henry Ward, lost to Republican Louie B. Nunn. While lieutenant governor he helped to rebuild the state's Democratic machine that helped him, among others, be elected. </p><p>In 1971 Ford made the decision to run for governor, against seven other candidates in the Democratic gubernatorial primary including Albert Chandler and his mentor Bert Combs. Ford won the general election and quickly began to reorganize executive departments and create a budget surplus for the state. Achievements during his tenure include increasing taxes on coal, gasoline, and corporations while exempting food from sales tax to increase the state's revenue. He expanded the state's education budget, applied funds to various construction projects across the commonwealth, and pushed for a six-year study on coal gasification and liquefaction after the 1973 oil crisis. Following his term as governor, Ford decided to challenge the republican incumbent Marlow Cook and won the 1974 election to the United States Senate. </p><p>His senatorial tenure spanned four consecutive terms, from 1974 to his retirement in 1999. He served on a variety of committees while in the Senate, including the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, the Select Committee to Study the Committee System, the Commerce Committee, and the Committee on Rules and Administration as well as forming the Senate National Guard Caucus to advance the National Guard's capabilities and readiness. From 1991 to 1995, he served as the Majority Whip, and then the Minority Whip from 1995 to 1999. Achievements in the Senate include defending Kentucky's cash crop, tobacco, by exempting it from the Consumer Product Safety Act, opposing cigarette tax increases, sponsoring an amendment that would limit the amount of foreign tobacco imported by the United States, and working to improve airports and airlines across Kentucky and the nation. One piece of legislation is named for Ford, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st century which is aimed at reducing aircraft noise, improving airline safety measures, and required airlines to better inform consumers about their performance which was signed into law on April 5, 2000. </p><p>Upon his retirement from the senate in 1999, he was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history, serving for a total of 24 years. He was an inductee to the Kentucky Transportation Center Hall of fame in 2008 for his service to bettering the state's transportation infrastructure. In 2014, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and passed away from the disease on January 22, 2015.</p>
