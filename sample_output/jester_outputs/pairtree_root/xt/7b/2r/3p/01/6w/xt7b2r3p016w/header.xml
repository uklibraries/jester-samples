          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Warren Bergen <emph render="doublequote">Bill</emph> Terry was born in a southern Illinois timber camp, near Vandalia, to William Bergen and Clester Hopkins Terry on August 11, 1918. He was the eldest of nine siblings. While in school, Terry worked many jobs, such as paperboy, movie theater popcorn vendor, and at a local coffee shop. After high school he worked for oil related businesses in Texas and Louisiana. After a workplace accident left him with a punctured lung, he took work at the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Corpus Christi, Texas, as a route-salesman and bookkeeper. During this time, he befriended and began to be mentored by  Samuel W. Dunnam, founder of the American Bottling Company. In 1941, at age 23, Terry was promoted to general manager of the plant and manager of several ranches owned by the bottling company owner. During this time he met and married Frances LaVerne Schnasse Terry. The couple raised four sons: Timothy, Warren B. Jr., S. Patrick, and W. Michael Terry. In 1948, he was part of a small group of investors who purchased the Coca-Cola bottling operation in San Jose, California. Mr. Terry later bought more bottling plants, including one purchased in 1965 in Lexington, Kentucky. He bought and sold about 31 bottling plants during his career. In the late 1960s Terry bought two horse farms in central Kentucky and then bought Domino Stud Farm in 1971. At Domino, Terry bred horses and raced multiple stakes winners. Despite being a private person, W.B. Terry became a prominent businessperson in Lexington, Kentucky. His experience in opening the Lexington Hilton Inn, a Howard's Inn, and the Louisville Hyatt Regency hotels, helped him play a key role in financing and opening the Marriott Griffin Gate Resort and Golf Course. Terry also served on city and university development boards and committees and was a generous philanthropist. He fundraised for Transylvania University rebuilding the Old Morrison building  after a fire on campus and gave to local causes like the Lexington Child Development Center. Although he only had a high-school education, Terry gave private scholarships to college students, many of whom were children of his employees. In 1992, Terry received a Doctor of Law Honoris Causa from Transylvania University.  Warren Bergen Terry died December 2, 2009 in Lexington, Kentucky. </p><p>References:
