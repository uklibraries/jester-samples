    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Antonio Munroe Ulrich (1918-1982) was born in Chester Del, Pennsylvania and adopted by Dr. Katharine Warner Ulrich (1870-1936). In 1940, Ulrich married Joanne Clark (1922-1980), whom he met when they were students at Fishburne Military School and Fairfax Hall respectively. Antonio and Joann Ulrich had three children: Clara Anne, Katherine, and F. Thomas Ulrich. Ulrich enlisted in the US Army in 1941, serving as a 2nd Lieutenant during World War II. He was a part of the Luzon Force, and was captured by the Japanese in April or May 1942. Ulrich would spend the remainder of the war in at least three Japanese prisoner of war [POW] camps, Osaka (Chikko), Zentsuji, and Rokuroski; finally being released around October 1945. Ulrich was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. </p><p>American Letters collector Wade Hall (1934-2015) was a native of Union Springs, Alabama.  Starting in 1962, he lived in Louisville, where he taught English and chaired the English and Humanities/Arts programs at Kentucky Southern College and Bellarmine University.  He also taught at the University of Illinois and the University of Florida.  He held degrees from Troy State University (B.S.), the University of Alabama (M.A.), and the University of Illinois (Ph.D.). He served for two years in the U.S. Army in the mid-fifties. Dr. Hall was the author of books, monographs, articles, plays, and reviews relating to Kentucky, Alabama, and Southern history and literature.  His most recent books include <title render="italic">A Visit with Harlan Hubbard</title>; <title render="italic">High Upon a Hill: A History of Bellarmine College</title>; <title render="italic">A Song in Native Pastures: Randy Atcher's Life in Country Music</title>; and <title render="italic">Waters of Life from Conecuh Ridge</title>.</p>  </bioghist>
