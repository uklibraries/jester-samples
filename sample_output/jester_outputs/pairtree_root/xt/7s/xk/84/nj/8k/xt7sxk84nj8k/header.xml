      <p>Kentucky University at Lexington, Kentucky (1865-1908), was founded by an act of the Kentucky Legislature on February 28, 1865, by consolidating Kentucky University at Harrodsburg, Kentucky (1858-1864) with Transylvania University (1798-1865) in Lexington. Both Transylvania and Kentucky Universities were Protestant-affiliated universities. Transylvania, in 1865, was administered by the Presbyterians and Kentucky University (Harrodsburg) was administered by the Disciples of Christ (or the Christian Church). Kentucky University had its roots in Bacon College (1837-1851), founded by three Disciples of Christ teachers in Georgetown, Kentucky, and moved to Harrodsburg in 1839 on the strength of $50,000 in pledges, most of which were never paid. </p><p>In 1855-1856, white lawyer and elite slave-owning landholder John Bryan Bowman (1824-1891)--an 1842 graduate of Bacon College and son of Mercer County lawyer and prosperous farmer John Bowman (one of the Bacon College founders)--raised $150,000 in pledges from Mercer County landowners to endow a new, comprehensive university for Kentucky that would be controlled by the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ.  This would be done by amending the Bacon College charter. Bowman and his family had been Baptists but had become Disciples of Christ in 1839 when Bowman was 15. </p><p>On January 15, 1858, the Kentucky Legislature approved this amended charter and changed the name of Bacon College to Kentucky University. The legislative act provided for a Board of thirty Curators, of whom two-thirds should be members of the Christian Church in Kentucky, placing the new institution under the denomination's control. Bowman served as General Agent for the university. In 1864, fire destroyed Kentucky University's main building, closing the school.  The Board of Curators appointed a committee including Bowman to look for a new location, not in Harrodsburg, with the proviso to repay the Bacon College and Mercer County donors on demand.  Citizens of Harrodsburg and donors to Kentucky University at Harrodsburg, however, opposed the removal of the university. </p><p>During the 1864-1865 legislative session, Bowman met in Frankfort with the chairman of the Transylvania University Board of Trustees to work out a plan for the merger of the two schools. Transylvania University had its roots in a Seminary (1780-1798) originally chartered in the Virginia Legislature in 1780. After a name change to Transylvania Seminary in 1783 and a gift of a lot in Lexington, Kentucky, by the Transylvania Land Company in 1793, the Seminary and a rival Lexington institution, the Kentucky Academy (1796-1798) were consolidated under the name Transylvania University on December 22, 1798, by an act of the Kentucky General Assembly. In 1856, the university was reorganized by a Kentucky legislative act to establish a Board of Trustees and a State Normal School (a school for teachers). In addition, each county could send a student to the university free of tuition.  On February 28, 1865, the Kentucky legislature established an act to consolidate Kentucky University and Transylvania University. The charter of the previous Kentucky University became the charter of the new Kentucky University. Bowman continued in his administrative role as Regent for Kentucky University and chair of the Executive Committee of the Board of Curators. </p><p>However, in 1865, Bowman also wanted to incorporate Kentucky's embryonic land-grant Agricultural and Mechanical College (A&amp;M College) into his vision for a comprehensive university with many different professional colleges to serve the state of Kentucky. In 1863, two years into the four year American Civil War (1861-1865), the Kentucky Legislature voted to accept the terms of the July 2, 1862, federal Morrill Land-Grant Act, which allocated 30,000 acres of public land per member of Congress to each state still in the Union to fund the establishment of a <emph render="doublequote">land-grant college</emph> that would teach the <emph render="doublequote">agricultural and mechanical arts</emph> as well as scientific and classical studies and military tactics to <emph render="doublequote">[white and male] members of the industrial classes.</emph> (<title render="doublequote">Morrill Land-Grant Acts,</title> Wikipedia.) The states would sell their <emph render="doublequote">land scrip</emph> (the land was a substitute for legal tender) to private investors to obtain cash to fund their land-grant college. In all, the Morrill Act redistributed 11 million acres of Northwest Territory–established as federal or public land through the Northwest Ordinance of 1787–between the Appalachian Mountains, British North America (i.e. Canada), the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River. This land was ceded to the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris, 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War. The Northwest Ordinance, however, dispossessed many Native American tribes of land west of the Ohio River that had been agreed upon as theirs at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the British Crown in 1768.</p><p>Each state that accepted the federal land scrip donation had to establish their land-grant college within five years, by July 1, 1867. Previously, Transylvania University had offered to house the A&amp;M College, but the bills to accomplish this had not been approved. Bowman proposed to make the college one of the units of the new Kentucky University and committed to raising $100,000 to endow it. On February 22, 1865, six days before the act consolidating Kentucky and Transylvania Universities, the Kentucky Legislature founded A&amp;M College as part of Kentucky University. The University's Board of Curators would receive the income from the sale of the land scrip and apply that income to operating A&amp;M College.  To address concerns about uniting the state college with a church-supported university, the legislature provided that the A&amp;M college would have its own Board of Visitors appointed by the governor.  The act also said that, in appointing employees, no partiality should be given to any section or religious denomination and nothing sectarian would be taught in the college. Finally, three students from each representative district would be entitled to attend A&amp;M and classes in other Kentucky University colleges tuition-free except for law and medicine. </p><p>The third step in the establishment of Kentucky University in 1865 was the legislative act, also on February 28, 1865, directing the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund to sell Kentucky's 330,000 acres of land scrip. The Legislature also loaned the Treasurer of Kentucky University $20,000 (never repaid) to allow the A&amp;M College to open in the fall of 1866. At a June 4, 1866, meeting at Ashland, a group of interested men (the governor, the A&amp;M College Board of Visitors, the Sinking Fund Commissioners, the Board of Directors of State Agricultural Society, and the Kentucky University Executive Committee of the Board of Curators) decided to sell all the land scrip immediately, even though there was a glut of public land on the market because of the Morrill Act, the military bounty system, and the Homestead Act. Madison C. Johnson, the agent, sold all the scrip at 50 cents per acre between June 1866 and January 1867 for a permanent endowment of $164,960 with an annual income of $9900. No specific land areas were directly allocated to the state. The acres purchased by the 2062 surrendered land scrip warrants (inventors turned in warrants certifying their land scrip purchase to land agents in exchange for the actual land) were located in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In addition to the annual income from the land scrip, A&amp;M College also had income from student fees and farm and shop revenue. However, Bowman had expected to obtain $1.00 per acre or more for an income of $20,000. And, yet, Kentucky University's obligation to the state to furnish land, buildings, and faculty for–and free tuition for 300 students at–the A&amp;M College was not reduced. </p><p>The Civil War ended in April 1865 (although fighting continued until early June). By May of that year, Bowman had raised $112,000 in pledges from at least 155 prosperous white men in Lexington and Fayette County for the buildings, farm, and equipment for A&amp;M College. Sixty-five of those donated $1000 each ($65,000 in total) and another 90 donated $500 each ($45,000 in total). Two months after the December 1865 ratification of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution abolishing slavery, by February 15, 1866, Bowman had agreed on the terms of the sale of the Ashland and Woodlands estates in Lexington on the Richmond Road, a campus of 433 acres. Costs were $85,000 and $5,000 tuition stock for Ashland and $40,000 for Woodlands, for a total expense of $125,000 in cash and $5,000 in stock. Bowman purchased Woodlands with his own money, then turned the property over to Kentucky University Kentucky in June 1869 when the university could repay him. Bowman set up a Real Estate and Building Fund for the Kentucky University at Lexington and continued to solicit subscriptions in ongoing support of the new institution, particularly Woodlands. Between 1867 and 1868 Bowman raised $45,000 (payable in three annual installments) from people from Bourbon County and other counties. In addition, Bowman refused a salary. The Curators offered him the free use of Ashland as his residence. Other buildings were similarly offered to presiding officers and professors with families. The former Transylvania campus comprised 20 acres including Morrison College and a dormitory built in 1839. Bowman made the final payment on the Woodlands mortgage between 1867 and 1868 and the final payment on Ashland in 1870-1871.</p><p>On October 2, 1865, classes held in Morrison College began for 223 students at the new Kentucky University's College of Arts (presiding officer Robert Graham); 37 students at the College of the Bible (presiding officer John W. McGarvey); 13 students in the College of Law; and the preparatory academy. The College of the Bible was formed from what had been the Department of Hebrew Literature at both Bacon College and the University of Kentucky at Harrodsburg. The College of Arts, the College of Law, and the preparatory academy had been part of Transylvania University. One year later, in October 1866, A&amp;M College opened on the former Ashland and Woodlands estates with presiding officer, John Augustus Williams; former Transylvania University professors Robert Peter and James K. Patterson; new professor Alexander Winchell; and tutor W.E. Arnold. A total of 190 students attended the university in the 1866-1867 school year. It was difficult to find instructors in agriculture and mechanics and no one in the United States had a definite plan for the organization of the Morrill agricultural colleges, as these fields were new to American education. Peter, a soil chemist, was an exception. Bowan visited some of the other land-grant schools in operation, read available material, and studied appropriate federal and state laws. From 1874 to 1877, Bowman was active on the federal level on behalf of land-grant colleges, including as a member of the Conference of Presidents and Other Delegates of State Universities and Colleges. The curriculum would need to impart practical business education, study, farm labor (at first required for all students), and military drill with a course of classical studies accompanied by strict discipline. The original plan was for A&amp;M College to have eleven schools:  Philosophy, English Language and Literature, Mathematics, Chemistry and Experimental Philosophy; Natural History; History; Commercial and Business School.  These were operating in 1866.  The other schools planned were for Modern Languages; Civil Engineering and Mining; and Fine Arts. In 1868, Williams stepped down as presiding officer. Joseph Desha Pickett served for a few months, then James K. Patterson (1833-1922) was appointed into the position. Patterson served as presiding officer of A&amp;M College through 1878, then continued as the first President of the independent A&amp;M College from 1878 to 1910.</p><p>Kentucky University enrollment peaked at 295 students during the 1869-1870 school year and then began declining to a low of 94 in 1875 and 110 in 1876. In addition, only 12 degrees had actually been granted by the university. Reasons for the decline included the rise of other colleges in the Mississippi Valley, the closure of various colleges in the university, various financial crises, and the lack of state financial support, but a significant problem facing the university was the presence of a secular college (A&amp;M) within a religious university and the increasingly wide and bitter schism among individual university faculty and Curators about how Biblically-centered university instruction should be. As early as 1867, only two years after the founding of the institution, the Kentucky Legislature appointed a committee to investigate whether A&amp;M College was being run along sectarian lines against the regulations of the statute. The committee found there was no cause for complaint.  Then, four years later, in 1871,  Bowman and Kentucky University professor J.D. Pickett both left the larger congregation of the Main Street Christian Church and founded the Second Christian Church (also called Broadway Christian Church) in a building that Main Street had purchased as an extension of its congregation.  Main Street Church Elders, and particularly John W. MacGarvey (presiding officer of the College of the Bible), Moses E. Lard, and L.B. Wilkes, all also connected with Kentucky University, were the most violently opposed to the new church.  As all were faculty at the university, this caused schisms and problems with the Board of Curators.  In particular, Bowman's opponents levied charges of financial mismanagement, especially in holding the Woodlands title. This started a movement to remove Bowman as Regent.  However, in 1872, the Board of Curators passed a resolution in support of Bowman, and another Kentucky Legislative investigating committee found that there had been no violation of the contract between the university and the state. </p><p>However, tempers of individual university professors and curators remained inflamed and individuals on both sides–including MacGarvey, Robert Peter, and E.B. Smith–wrote accusatory articles in the <title render="doublequote">Apostolic Times</title>, the local Christian Church newspaper and in other pamphlets and broadsides. In response, on July 13, 1873, the Board of Curators passed a peace and harmony resolution. MacGarvey and Smith continued to publish angry notices, and the Executive Committee of the Board asked both to resign. Smith complied, but MacGarvey refused and was then suspended from the presidency of the College of the Bible. This action only infuriated MacGarvey and his supporters, as Bowman was chair of the Executive Committee. Many sent petitions for MacGarvey's reinstatement to the full Board. The Board set up a special committee to examine and report on the petitions opposing McGarvey's dismissal. In the meantime, the Board upheld the Executive Committee's decision. The special committee could not agree and, in September 1873, returned a majority and a minority report to the Board. Following this, Bowman offered to resign from his posts as Regent and Treasurer of the university, but the Board unanimously insisted he continue. </p><p>As before, these actions only increased the ire of MacGarvey's supporters. Also, the financial state of the university was precarious, and the Board began to see Bowman as the culprit. As part of the economic Panic of 1873 in the United States and Europe, the university lost funds it had invested in the Short Line Railroad and the Commercial Bank of Kentucky. Professors were being paid in promissory notes, earlier contributors were withdrawing their support, the number of students was decreasing, and even persuasive Bowman was not able to raise new subscriptions. In 1874, by his request, the board appointed D.S. Goodloe as Treasurer, replacing Bowman in that role. That same year, B.L. Swopes prepared an audit. In late 1873 and January 1874, individuals and Christian Churches in Kentucky sent petitions to the Kentucky Legislature to separate A&amp;M College and Kentucky University. At the same legislative session, Bowman lobbied for a change to the university charter to reduce the two-thirds majority of Christian Church members on the Board of Curators to one-half. Although the proposed bill to separate the two institutions was defeated by a slim margin, the change to the charter was also not supported. Bowman's actions made him even more enemies on the Board and among the university's Christian Church supporters. Later that year, the Board passed a series of resolutions expressing their belief that the Christian Churches in Kentucky had control of the university and disclaiming any move to secularize it.</p><p>In the midst of Kentucky University's  financial difficulties, in June 1875, following the March death of College of the Bible president Robert Milligan, the Board voted to start an endowment campaign for the College. In addition, they offered the Kentucky Christian Education Society the opportunity to nominate two professors for the College if the Society paid their salaries. John MacGarvey and Robert Graham were selected and student enrollment in the College went up.  In 1876, the Board began selling sections of Ashland and Woodlands to pay off the university's growing debts. Also in that year, the Board disapproved some of the Executive Committee's decisions in support of Bowman's actions to secure funds, such as selling the 1874 hemp crop, renting out the farm, and the investment contract with the Short Line Railroad. The Board also demanded that Bowman turn over his former Treasurer's documents to the Executive Committee. Bowman responded that the Executive Committee was already in possession of them.</p><p>In April 1877, the Executive Committee suspended Bowman as Regent, but in June of that year, the full Board voted to repudiate the committee's action and reinstate him. Accountant B.L. Swopes was retained to conduct another audit. The financial situation of the university was still precarious. Without the support of the Christian Church (which by this point did not support Bowman), there would not be enough money for A&amp;M College. Bowman was reluctant to turn over the Treasurer's accounts to Goodloe and the Board at its next session had to issue him specific orders to do so.  A new effort was made to remove him. Concurrently, in the summer of 1877, the Kentucky Christian Education Society raised enough funds for a separate and independent College of the Bible, and the A&amp;M College Board of Visitors found that the Kentucky University Board of Curators had moved courses formerly taught in the College of Arts into A&amp;M College. This used up so much money in A&amp;M's state fund that there was not enough left to provide instruction in the agricultural and mechanical arts. Thus, in the Visitors' view, the connection between the A&amp;M College and the university was no longer advantageous to the state. </p><p>In January 1878, the Kentucky Legislature established a special investigating committee to hold hearings on the condition of Kentucky University. Bowman made a secret proposal to the committee to change the university charter to remove all church control of the Board. The proposal was leaked to MacGarvey, who publicized it in the <title render="doublequote">Apostolic Times</title>. This was the final blow for the combination of secular A&amp;M College and church-run university. On March 13, 1878, the Legislature passed an act repealing the act approved on February 22, 1865, and establishing the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky as an independent and state institution. A month earlier, February 1878, the new, independent College of the Bible had been chartered and the College of the Bible within Kentucky University had ceased to function. Robert Graham was the first president of this independent college. From 1878 to 1895, when it moved into its own building, the school shared Morrison Hall with the College of Arts.  After John W. MacGarvey's death in 1911, from 1912-1938, the school shared facilities and presidents with the former Kentucky University/Transylvania University. The college moved to a new campus in 1950 and became Lexington Theological Seminary in 1965. Thus, in March 1878 with the removal of A&amp;M College and the College of the Bible, what remained of Kentucky University was the College of Arts, a small law department, and an informal relationship begun in 1877 with the independent downtown Lexington Commercial College to train students as secretaries and bookkeepers. </p><p>The Kentucky University Board of Curators agreed to operate A&amp;M College at Ashland and Woodlands for the next two years while the college looked for a permanent location, as the university, not the College, owned those properties. In June 1878, they also abolished the office of Regent–effectively firing Bowman–and established a new office of the President, electing Henry H. White (1821-1903) to the post. White had been a student and mathematics instructor at Bacon College and Kentucky University and presiding officer of the College of Arts (1868-1878). In 1880, White resigned from the presidency to return to teaching but became university treasurer until 1901. From 1878-1879, a gradual transfer of university financial holdings held by Bowman to others took place, mostly through court cases, including a case 1879-1880 between Bowman and the University. In November 1878, the Fayette County Court ordered the university to sell Ashland and Woodlands estates to satisfy creditors, although A&amp;M College continued to rent the land and buildings and hold classes there until early 1882. In 1879, the Board asked Bowman to vacate Ashland and to turn over all financial documents. He remained a member of the Board of Curators, but stopped attending meetings, and on July 25, 1879, his board seat was declared vacant. Bowman had married Mary Dorcas Williams (1826-1916) in 1846. Between 1880 and 1887, they moved westward, living in New Mexico and Colorado Territory because of poor health. During this time, Bowman became interested in irrigation and also spent time in Washington, DC, lobbying for Congressional appropriation for an irrigation project. He died in 1891 in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, at the home of his brother-in-law John Augustus Williams.</p><p>Between 1879-1880, the City of Lexington and the Fayette County Court donated a 52-acre city park and $50,000 in city and county bonds for building construction to A&amp;M College to keep it in Lexington, over a vigorous competition from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Supplementary legislative acts in January and February 1880 authorized the city and county court to make the donations each had promised and to levy taxes for the bond payments. Two more legislative acts in March and April 1880 incorporated the College and organized a Board of Trustees and their roles and responsibilities (replacing the Board of Visitors). Otherwise, most of the original charter remained intact. Another legislative act at the end of April 1880 authorized a special property tax (half a cent on each 100 dollars of taxable property in the state) to endow the school.  On February 15, 1882, after three new buildings had been built and Patterson had taken out a personal loan for $35,000 to finish them, A&amp;M College faculty and students (often also called <emph render="doublequote">State College</emph>) moved into its new campus. Those students now included white women, who were allowed to matriculate starting in 1880. The College grew substantially in faculty, students, departments, and courses over the next twenty-six years. The Kentucky Experiment Station was established in 1885, two years before the federal Hatch Act of 1897 allocated federal funds to land-grant colleges for experiment stations. On March 18, 1908, a legislative act changed the name of A&amp;M College to <emph render="doublequote">State University, Lexington, Kentucky</emph> and established new departments and responsibilities for the new university. Two days later, on March 20, 1908, another legislative act changed the name of Kentucky University to <emph render="doublequote">Transylvania University</emph> to avoid confusion between the two universities in Lexington.  In 1916, the Kentucky Legislature changed the name of State University to <emph render="doublequote">University of Kentucky,</emph> which is this institution's current name.</p><p>During the 30 years between 1878 and 1908, Kentucky University also grew and changed. In 1889, white women students were allowed to attend all classes except in the College of the Bible (which admitted them in 1904). In 1894, a gymnasium was constructed, and, in 1895, a separate building for the College of the Bible was built next to Morrison Hall. From 1898 to 1908, Kentucky University agreed to provide the university name and the university president's signature on the diplomas for an independently chartered and operated <emph render="doublequote">Medical Department/Medical College of Kentucky University,</emph> managed and funded by two different groups of physicians in Louisville.  In 1899, Kentucky University celebrated the centennial of the creation of Transylvania University. In 1903, Kentucky University assumed full control of Hamilton College (1903-1932) and restructured it as a junior college for women, granting two-year degrees. This school had its roots in Hocker Female College (1869-1877) which became Hamilton Female College (1877-1903). After Transylvania University closed Hamilton College in 1932, the building was used as a dormitory for women students. In 1908, a science building funded by a 1905 donation of $25,000 from Andrew Carnegie and matching funds from B.A. Thomas of Shelbyville, Kentucky, opened. The College/Department of Law operated spasmodically from 1869 to 1895, then opened again from 1905 to 1912. The preparatory academy began to phase out in 1902 and closed in 1915.  In 1908, the same year of the return to the name Transylvania University, the Board of Curators voted to amend the university's charter to eliminate the provision that two-thirds of the Curators be members of the Christian Church in Kentucky.</p><p>List of Kentucky University at Lexington Regents/Presidents in chronological order: John Bryan Bowman (Regent, 1865-1878); Henry H.

Swopes. </p><p>The administrative and legal records include Board of Curators, Board of Curators Executive Committee, and Board of Trustees meeting minutes; faculty meeting minutes; property leases and deeds; petitions, judgements, and court orders relating to John B. Bowman, Kentucky University, and the Agricultural and Mechanical College; petitions from community members to administrators in favor of or against university actions, including the move of the university from Harrodsburg to Lexington; William T. Withers correspondence with John B. Bowman (1871-1879); and history pamphlets and handwritten history notes. The museum records include collection item records and information for the Kentucky University Museum of Natural History that was created and managed by the Agricultural and Mechanical College at the Ashland Estate. The printed publications, invitations and reports include the annual catalog and announcements; commencement, Founder's Day, and other event programs; university charters, laws, statutes, rules, and regulations; student literary society magazines; newspaper clippings about the university; and regent, treasurer, and Agricultural and Mechanical College reports. </p><p>
      As the bound volumes were numbered in the order in which they were received, there is also a numerically organized list of all the bound volumes in the collection.  The title and dates of each volume are given, along with the name of the series and subseries in the collection to which the volume belongs.  In addition, throughout the collection, there are library/reference correspondence and subject files compiled by librarians.  These are indicated by the prefixes <emph render="doublequote">Subject file:</emph> or <emph render="doublequote">Secondary correspondence:.</emph></p><p>This collection is not complete and is made up of documents and bound volumes acquired by the Tranyslvania University Library over time and from multiple, mainly unknown, sources. The Library gathered them together into Record Group 5 of the Transylvania University Archives. Many Kentucky University records were lost in the 1969 fire that gutted the Morrison College building/Old Morrison which housed the university's administrative offices. The collection is on loan to the University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections Research Center for archival processing and digitization.</p>

        <head>Scope and Contents</head>
        <p>The Treasury Series, dated from 1837 to 1971 and undated, primarily comprises general ledgers and supporting documents; student financial accounts; Treasurer's reports and Treasurer bonds; property, stock, and investment and donations and fundraising documents; and two sets of audit reports and statements (1874 and 1877) created by the Kentucky University Treasurer, Registrar, Regent, members of the Board of Curators Executive Committee and auditor B.L. Swopes. The series also includes Samuel Hatch's Treasurer's book and <emph render="doublequote">student session lists</emph> for Bacon College (1837-1839, Volume V5.10). The general ledgers and supporting documents,  the audit reports, the Treasurer's reports, and the student financial accounts document both the accounting procedures used by the university as well as the day-to-day and yearly activities, income, and expenses, and employees of the university, especially from 1857 to 1882.  The university's account procedures changed over time, but generally included day books (daily logs of transactions in chronological order), journals (chronological recording of credits and debits in matched pairs), and general ledgers (records of the journal entries posted to the correct account and showing starting and ending account balances).  The audit statements and reports also include annual balance sheets (a <emph render="doublequote">statement of financial position</emph> for a specific point in time summarizing assets, liabilities, and equity) for 1855 to 1877 June.  </p>
        <p>The invoices, receipts and vouchers (an accounting document that represents an organization's intent to pay an external entity) included in the general ledger supporting documents are not complete.  They date from 1871 to 1879.  However, these supporting documents do include names of the companies with which the University was doing business and their goods and services.  The salary and wage vouchers, checks, and receipts also include the names of faculty, staff, farm workers (both adults and university students) and other laborers.  Those names that are clearly female and/or those after which the term <emph render="doublequote">(colored)</emph> was included on the salary and wage document are listed in the description for each folder of supporting documents.   </p>
        <p>Fundraising documents include promissory notes recording pledges of financial support for Kentucky University from individual donors (1864-1907). Other Kentucky University supporters purchased tuition stock certificates instead (1860-1893), which allowed a student or students of their choice to attend the university with their tuition already paid. The majority of the bonds included in the series are from Kentucky University treasurers (1870-1901), who in a "surety bond" agree to be liable up to a certain monetary amount for paying any damages caused by their failure to meet their obligations. However, there are also a few stock certificates and bonds purchased by Kentucky University in banks, companies, and Fayette county (1859-1885). The property records include Ashland and Woodlands estates and Ashland house lease agreements and lists of property (1871-1876), as well as Ashland estate sale accounts and receipt (1878).  </p>
        <p>The Treasury Series is arranged into nine subseries by subject and thereunder in chronological order. For printed and published Treasurer's reports, see the Printed Materials Series.</p>
