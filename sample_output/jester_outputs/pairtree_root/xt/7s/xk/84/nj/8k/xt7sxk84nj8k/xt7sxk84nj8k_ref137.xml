Swopes. The series also includes Samuel Hatch's Treasurer's book and <emph render="doublequote">student session lists</emph> for Bacon College (1837-1839, Volume V5.10). The general ledgers and supporting documents, the audit reports, the Treasurer's reports, and the student financial accounts document both the accounting procedures used by the university as well as the day-to-day and yearly activities, income, and expenses, and employees of the university, especially from 1857 to 1882. The university's account procedures changed over time, but generally included day books (daily logs of transactions in chronological order), journals (chronological recording of credits and debits in matched pairs), and general ledgers (records of the journal entries posted to the correct account and showing starting and ending account balances). The audit statements and reports also include annual balance sheets (a <emph render="doublequote">statement of financial position</emph> for a specific point in time summarizing assets, liabilities, and equity) for 1855 to 1877 June. </p> <p>The invoices, receipts and vouchers (an accounting document that represents an organization's intent to pay an external entity) included in the general ledger supporting documents are not complete. They date from 1871 to 1879. However, these supporting documents do include names of the companies with which the University was doing business and their goods and services. The salary and wage vouchers, checks, and receipts also include the names of faculty, staff, farm workers (both adults and university students) and other laborers. Those names that are clearly female and/or those after which the term <emph render="doublequote">(colored)</emph> was included on the salary and wage document are listed in the description for each folder of supporting documents. </p> <p>Fundraising documents include promissory notes recording pledges of financial support for Kentucky University from individual donors (1864-1907). Other Kentucky University supporters purchased tuition stock certificates instead (1860-1893), which allowed a student or students of their choice to attend the university with their tuition already paid. The majority of the bonds included in the series are from Kentucky University treasurers (1870-1901), who in a "surety bond" agree to be liable up to a certain monetary amount for paying any damages caused by their failure to meet their obligations. However, there are also a few stock certificates and bonds purchased by Kentucky University in banks, companies, and Fayette county (1859-1885). The property records include Ashland and Woodlands estates and Ashland house lease agreements and lists of property (1871-1876), as well as Ashland estate sale accounts and receipt (1878). </p> <p>The Treasury Series is arranged into nine subseries by subject and thereunder in chronological order.
