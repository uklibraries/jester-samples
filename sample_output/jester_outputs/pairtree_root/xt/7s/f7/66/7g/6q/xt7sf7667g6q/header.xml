      <p>Henrietta Alice McCrea was born into a wealthy Chicago family in 1888. She was taken to Paris, France, at an early age and spoke French as her native tongue. She was married twice: first to the landscape painter Willard Lloyd Metcalf (1858-1925) and for a short time to the author Marcus Aurelius Goodrich (1897-1991). Both marriages ended in divorce, but she reverted to Metcalf's name for the rest of her life. She and Willard Metcalf had two children, Addison and Rosalind. Additionally, in 1952, she took in a boy named Jacobus Arnoldus who inherited a portion of her estate.</p><p>She was an avid fan of theater and actors and amassed a large collection of autographed photographs and other memorabilia. Metcalf also translated French works into English: Alexandre Dumas' play <title render="italic">Camille</title> and Anatole France's story <title render="italic">Our Lady's Juggler</title>.</p><p>In 1928 she began an affair with Thelma Wood, the lover of the novelist Djuna Barnes. This prompted Barnes to satirize Metcalf in her novel, <title render="italic">Nightwood</title>. Metcalf appears as the character Jenny Petherbridge. Metcalf and Wood's relationship lasted until 1943, and they did not part on goodvterms.</p><p>Metcalf died in 1981.</p><p>Kevin Lane Dearinger was born in Kentucky in 1951. An actor, author, and playwright, his published works include <title render="italic">The Bard and the Bluegrass</title> (2007), <title render="italic">Marie Prescott: A Star of Some Brilliance</title> (2009), and <title render="italic">Bad Sex in Kentucky</title> (2019). </p><p>Sources:</p><p>"Bad Sex in Kentucky, An Interview with Kevin Lane Dearinger," <title render="italic">Lexington Public Library</title>, 2019, https://www.lexpublib.org/podcasts/bad-sex-kentucky-interview-kevin-lane-dearinger-2019.</p><p>McCrea-Metcalf, New York Times, page 13, 1910 Dec 13, Newspapers.com, accessed 2022 May 24.
