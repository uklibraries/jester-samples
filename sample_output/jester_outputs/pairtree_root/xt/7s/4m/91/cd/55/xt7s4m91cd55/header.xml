          <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Prior to the introduction of antibiotics in the 20th century, medical practitioners relied heavily upon natural plants, such as herbs, seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark or flowers, for medicinal formulations. Herbal medicines often helped heal symptoms or alieviate discomfort during an illness. The unknown 19th century person, possibly a physician or pharmacist, who created this journal of medical recipes using plants and other natural substances, likely used the small journal as a reference book for their recipes.</p>
