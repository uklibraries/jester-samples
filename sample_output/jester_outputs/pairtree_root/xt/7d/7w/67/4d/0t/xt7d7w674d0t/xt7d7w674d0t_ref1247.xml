She first submitted the typescript to Macmillan, who rejected it. She submitted the same draft to Harold Strauss at Covici Friede, where it was subsequently published. Mr. Strauss initially warned Arnow that the draft in its then-current form would meet opposition, calling it <title render="doublequote">another hillbilly novel somewhat melodramatic in nature</title> in a letter dated March 12, 1936, and encouraged revisions (Box 30, Folder 1). Arnow's first literary agent, Elizabeth Nowell, submitted the draft to a contest by Houghton Mifflin publishers after Covici Friede's initial hesitance to publish, a move which <title render="doublequote">nearly wrecked [HSA's] chance of publication,</title> according to a letter by Galena Hopkins on April 14, 1936 (Box 33, Folder 2). Arnow terminated her contract with Ms. Nowell in April 1936 and requested to withdraw the book from Houghton Mifflin. Arnow began working with Galena Hopkins in April 1936.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1248" level="file"/> <c id="ref1249" level="file"/> <c id="ref1250" level="subseries"/> </c>
