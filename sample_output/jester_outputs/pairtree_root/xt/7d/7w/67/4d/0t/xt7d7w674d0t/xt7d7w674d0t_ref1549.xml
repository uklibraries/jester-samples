Stories are arranged alphabetically; where a story undergoes a title change in revision, it is cross-referenced to its counterpart. While there are no exact dates of composition for these stories, there are some clues as to the general chronological order of the stories, as most drafts have a return address in the upper left-hand corner. </p> <p>The breakdown is as follows: Burnside (c. 1920s): <title render="doublequote">Dreams Come True,</title> <title render="doublequote">The Goat Who Was Cow,</title> <title render="doublequote">Winky Creek's New Song.</title> </p> <p>Cincinnati (c. early 1930s): <title render="doublequote">Blessed--Blessed</title> (later draft), <title render="doublequote">An Episode In The Life of Ezekial Whitmore</title> (later draft), <title render="doublequote">Home Coming,</title> <title render="doublequote">Ketchup Making Saturday</title> (later draft), <title render="doublequote">No Lady</title>, <title render="doublequote">Sugar Tree Holler</title>, <title render="doublequote">Tin Cup</title>, <title render="doublequote">White Collar Woman</title>. </p> <p>Covington (c. 1930s): <title render="doublequote">Almost Two Thousand Years</title>, <title render="doublequote">The First Ride</title>,<title render="doublequote"> Fra Lippi and Me,</title> <title render="doublequote">The Hunters </title>(a.k.a. The Two Hunters), <title render="doublequote">Zekie the Hill-Billy Mouse</title>. Keno (c. 1939-1944): <title render="doublequote">The Gift</title>, <title render="doublequote">Jamboree </title>(both later changed to Detroit on typescript), <title render="doublequote">The Lesson</title>. </p> <p>Detroit (c. mid-1940s): <title render="doublequote">King Devil's Bargain</title>. </p> <p>While these stories probably were not written in this order, sorting them by this method at least gives some hint as to their date of completion and submission to periodicals. Further information can be gleaned from the log Arnow kept in the 1930s, tracking the completion and submission of various stories (see Box 2, Folder 42). An interesting side note is the existence of the <title render="doublequote">H. Simpson</title> responsible for <title render="doublequote">An Episode In the Life...</title>, <title render="doublequote">The Hunter</title> and <title render="doublequote">The Two Hunters</title>. The stories themselves are certainly Harriette Arnow's work, dating back to her writing at Burnside, but <title render="doublequote">The Hunter</title> and <title render="doublequote">The Two Hunters</title> were published under pen names. <title render="italic">Esquire</title> published <title render="doublequote">The Two Hunters</title> in July 1942, a reprint of Harriette Simpson's <title render="doublequote">The Hunters</title>, with credit on the author page going to <title render="doublequote">H.L Simpson</title>, pictured and described as a man, with no mention of Harriette (while she jokingly refers to this incident in her letters with editor Harold Strauss, there is no mention of who the man in the picture is; <title render="italic">Esquire</title> thought they were printing a story by a man. The story was republished in the Fall 1979 <title render="italic">Appalachian Heritage </title>and credited to Harriette Arnow. <title render="doublequote">The Hunter</title>, in the <title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title>, November 1944, is credited to <title render="doublequote">H. Arnow</title> (the pen name of a husband-and wife-collaboration) (p. 79). </p> <p>Whether this collaboration was a true writing and editing team or a compromise to the publishing industry is unknown. This collection houses 34 complete stories and two lengthy fragments. Of these 34, 18 are stories never published in any form (plus, obviously, the two fragments), 6 are unpublished drafts excerpted from longer works that were published later and the remaining 10 are published. In addition to these stories, several drafts of a story entitled <title render="doublequote">The Lamb Money</title> are in the Hunter's Horn series. It is known that she submitted a draft of this story to <title render="italic">The Atlantic Monthly</title>. However, due to missing pages, it is unclear which, if any, of these drafts were intended to be published as a short story; therefore, that story is not included here. </p> <p>The publishing history of those stories is as follows: 1934:<title render="doublequote">Marigolds and Mules</title> (<title render="italic">Kosmos</title>, August/September). 1935:<title render="doublequote">A Mess of Pork</title> (<title render="italic">The New Talent</title>, October-December). 1936:<title render="doublequote">The Washerwoman's Day</title> (<title render="italic">Southern Review</title>, 1). 1942:<title render="doublequote">The Two Hunters</title> (<title render="italic">Esquire</title>, July). 1944:<title render="doublequote">The Hunter</title> (<title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title>, November). 1963:<title render="doublequote">The Washerwoman's Day </title>(reprint) (<title render="italic">Deep Summer - Kentucky Writing</title>, Number 4). 1971:<title render="doublequote">Love?</title> (<title render="italic">Twigs</title>, Fall). 1973:<title render="doublequote">The Washerwoman's Day </title>(reprint) (<title render="italic">Appalachian Heritage</title>, Fall). 1979:<title render="doublequote">Fra Lippi and Me</title> (<title render="italic">Georgia Review</title>, Winter); <title render="doublequote">The Two Hunters</title> (reprint) (<title render="italic">Appalachian Heritage</title>, Fall). 1980:<title render="doublequote">Interruptions to School at Home</title> (<title render="italic">Adena</title>, Spring). 1981:<title render="doublequote">The Washerwoman's Day</title> (reprint) (<title render="italic">I Have A Place</title>, an anthology published by Alice Lloyd College). 1986:<title render="doublequote"> Fra Lippi and Me</title> (reprint) (<title render="italic">Georgia Review</title>, 40th Anniversary Fiction Retrospective, Spring). 1988:<title render="doublequote">Blessed--Blessed</title> (<title render="italic">Appalachian Heritage</title>, Spring/Summer). 1989:<title render="doublequote">The First Ride</title> (<title render="italic">Appalachian Heritage</title>, Fall). Unfortunately, it appears that the final drafts of the stories published early in Arnow's career, like <title render="doublequote">The Washerwoman's Day </title>and <title render="doublequote">A Mess of Pork</title>, were kept by their respective publisher. </p> <p>All photocopies of published stories are from the original magazine, except where noted. As for the untitled stories below, no information is given by Arnow in the margins or in a heading as to their date of composition. In these cases, each story's first line and cast of characters are given to aid the reader.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1550" level="file"/> <c id="ref1551" level="file"/> <c id="ref1552" level="file"/> <c id="ref1553" level="file"/> <c id="ref1554" level="file"/> <c id="ref1555" level="file"/> <c id="ref1556" level="file"/> <c id="ref1557" level="file"/> <c id="ref1558" level="file"/> <c id="ref1559" level="file"/> <c id="ref1560" level="file"/> <c id="ref1561" level="file"/> <c id="ref1562" level="file"/> <c id="ref1563" level="file"/> <c id="ref1564" level="file"/> <c id="ref1565" level="file"/> <c id="ref1566" level="file"/> <c id="ref1567" level="file"/> <c id="ref1568" level="file"/> <c id="ref1569" level="file"/> <c id="ref1570" level="file"/> <c id="ref1571" level="file"/> <c id="ref1572" level="file"/> <c id="ref1573" level="file"/> <c id="ref1574" level="file"/> <c id="ref1575" level="file"/> <c id="ref1576" level="file"/> <c id="ref1577" level="file"/> <c id="ref1578" level="file"/> <c id="ref1579" level="file"/> <c id="ref1580" level="file"/> <c id="ref1581" level="file"/> <c id="ref1582" level="file"/> <c id="ref1583" level="file"/> <c id="ref1584" level="file"/> <c id="ref1585" level="file"/> <c id="ref1586" level="file"/> <c id="ref1587" level="file"/> <c id="ref1588" level="file"/> <c id="ref1589" level="file"/> <c id="ref1590" level="file"/> <c id="ref1591" level="file"/> <c id="ref1592" level="file"/> <c id="ref1593" level="file"/> </c>
