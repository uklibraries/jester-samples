With a few exceptions, pages were not in sequential order, and different versions and different formats (original typescript and carbon) were mixed together. Although certain pages apparently followed in sequence, it was not always clear with which version a fragment belonged. Moreover, many pages were missing. Arnow often used the reverse side of apparently discarded manuscripts to type something else. In some of her later works such as <title render="italic">Weedkiller's Daughter,</title> these discarded pages were from an earlier manuscript. However, in <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn </title>the discarded pages are, for the most part, from earlier versions of the same manuscript making the task of processing extremely difficult. It was not always clear which version came first. An attempt was made to place both versions within the logical progression of the manuscript. When the later version could be determined, the original was placed there and a photocopy of the earlier version was placed in an appropriate place. When it could not be determined which came first, the original was placed within the sequence of the most complete version and a photocopy was placed with the other version. </p> <p>In an attempt to make the many fragments of the manuscript more accessible, the fragments were grouped as Early Drafts, Middle Drafts, and Later Drafts. These drafts were then sorted into versions. It must be emphasized that this arrangement into versions does not necessarily represent Arnow's own order or sequence. Rather the parts were pieced together by an educated guess as to what the original and appropriate order might have been. Some versions represent only a chapter or small portion of the novel because a definite link to another sequence could not be determined. It is quite probable that Arnow did not view these sequences as integral versions but rather as reworkings of particular parts of the manuscript. Where possible, an indication of the rough correspondence between the fragmented versions and the published first edition has been given. Also included are versions of chapters with headers that include Arnow's name and address. It is possible that these chapters were submitted as short stories or excerpts from the novel. Arnow worked on the manuscript for many years. Over the course of these years, Arnow changed the order and direction of the story several times. Although many of the incidents in the Early and Middle Drafts also occur in the Later Draft, the sequence of events is different. Therefore, it was very difficult to arrange the manuscript in a logical order. </p> <p>Macmillan accepted the manuscript for publication in 1946, but the book was not published until 1949 after extensive revisions and other problems. Correspondence between Arnow, her editor Granville Hicks, and Macmillan reveals several quarrels over the length of the book, its title, and the lack of definitive action by Macmillan to publish the book. Only after Arnow, encouraged by Hicks, pursued a contract with another publisher did Macmillan finalize the deal. Cecil Scott, an editor at Macmillan, was also involved with this manuscript (See <title render="italic">The Dollmaker</title>). Although parts of the story first appear in the Early and Middle Drafts, it is not until the Later Draft versions that the novel has assumed a general shape close to the published version. Arnow was particularly upset by Macmillan's decision to rename the manuscript. The original title <title render="doublequote">End of the Gravel</title> was considered too vague and regional to have mass appeal. Other possible titles included <title render="doublequote">King Devil</title> and <title render="doublequote">The Hills Remain</title>. The title <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn</title> was never satisfactory to Arnow because she felt it gave the impression of English-style fox hunting which is nothing like fox hunting in the hills of Kentucky. In later years, Arnow referred to the novel as <title render="doublequote">the horn</title>. In a note found with the manuscript, Arnow states that the original manuscript sent to Macmillan was destroyed, but she does not elaborate. There is some confusion over a <title render="doublequote">missing </title>chapter of <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn</title>. Upon surveying the four copies of the novel in Special Collections, discrepancies were found. The original version which was used to write this inventory [New York : Macmillan, 1949 (1st printing)] contains 38 chapters. Another version published later (New York : Macmillan, c1949) contains only 37 chapters. A version published in Great Britain (c1950) contains all 38 chapters. A 1986 edition by the University Press of Kentucky is a reprint of the c1949 version with only 37 chapters. The controversial Chapter 30 concerns the illnesses of Lureenie and her children due to starvation. No apparent reason for the omission was determined from the books or from the correspondence. Also included with this manuscript are fragments that could not be placed within a version, summaries of the story, notes, and a hand-drawn map of the Ballew area. Some pages contain typescript on back. When this appears to be only typing mistakes or false starts, it was not noted. A child's scribbling appears throughout the manuscript. Roman numeral and quoted chapter headings were given by Arnow.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref841" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref885" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref973" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1011" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1072" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1086" level="item"/> </c>
