Like its unpublished counterpart, <title render="italic">To You No Place</title>, <title render="italic">Belle </title>is a decidedly unfinished work with physical evidence of heavy reworking and large gaps in the narrative. Unlike <title render="italic">To You No Place</title>, though, we lack a complete, coherent set of manuscripts to help us gauge Arnow's creative process. As a result, <title render="italic">Belle's</title> method of composition and ultimate direction are not self-evident. While notebooks, pieces of drafts and a working version exist for <title render="italic">Belle</title>, none of these are complete in the conventional sense; the reader is left to work through the gaps in the collection and accept that <title render="italic">Belle</title> was left a work-in-progress at the time of Arnow's death.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref531" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref556" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref599" level="subseries"/> </c>
