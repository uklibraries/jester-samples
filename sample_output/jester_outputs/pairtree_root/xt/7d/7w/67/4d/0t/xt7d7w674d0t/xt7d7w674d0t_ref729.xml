This notebook is continued by Notebook XXIIIV which corresponds to p. 11-13 of draft. Since XXIIIV also contains section corresponding to first edition of <title render="italic">The Dollmaker</title> p. 138-141, it is in the proper order with the other notebooks used in the book. XXIIIV has pages that might correspond to p. 14-16 of <title render="doublequote">The Dollmaker's Children</title>, but we have no typed draft of those pages. Typed draft of <title render="doublequote">The Dollmaker's Children</title> with corrections (p. 1-11, 11 two p. 11s, 13, 17). No actual title on draft, but it appears to be an earlier version judging from two page draft by that title.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
