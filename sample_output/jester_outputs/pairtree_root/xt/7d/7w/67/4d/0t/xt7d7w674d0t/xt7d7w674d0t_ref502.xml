Part of the reasoning behind this conclusion is that Josephine signs the letters alternately using <title render="doublequote">Gram</title>, <title render="doublequote">Mom</title>, <title render="doublequote">Mother</title>, and <title render="doublequote">Jo</title>. Josephine writes mostly about family events and matters, including how her children and grandchildren are doing. Includes discussions on Vietnam, McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, Wayne State University, ACLU, Dissenting Democrats, Paris Peace Negotiations, and Nasser's death.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
