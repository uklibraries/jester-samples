In the earlier, shorter draft, HSA refers to the male lead character as <title render="doublequote">Wash</title>, yet the readers' reports refer to <title render="doublequote">Marsh</title>, a change noted in the longer draft of this collection. However, the reports do not refer to the longer, later draft, either; the page references do not match with the longer draft of this collection. It is unclear how many intermediary drafts HSA undertook, so it is impossible to determine which of those drafts the readers' reports reference. Letters to and from Mr. Strauss, dated October 1937 (Box 30, Folder 1), mention the readers' reports.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
