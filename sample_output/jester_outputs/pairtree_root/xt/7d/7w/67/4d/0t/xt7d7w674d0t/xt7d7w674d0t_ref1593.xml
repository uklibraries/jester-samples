In addition to the rejection slips and letters from editors, Arnow kept a logbook of her various submissions early in her writing career. The contents are mostly self-evident (submitted stories are itemized by their dates of submission and return, then listed separately in a sort of inventory; addresses are given for magazines and literary contacts). Several stories apparently submitted to major magazines are not found in our collection. These include <title render="doublequote">Please the Guests</title> (submitted to <title render="italic">Author's Exchange</title>), <title render="doublequote">Crazy Blanket</title> (Curtis Publications and <title render="italic">Writer's Digest</title>), <title render="doublequote">Madame Butterfly</title> (<title render="italic">Liberty </title>and <title render="italic">College Humor</title>). Other stories with unfamiliar titles are: <title render="doublequote">Algebra is Simple</title>, <title render="doublequote">Two of a Kind</title>, <title render="doublequote">Mountain Woman</title>, <title render="doublequote">She Hated Him</title>, <title render="doublequote">Chick Girl</title>, <title render="doublequote">Secretary</title>. <title render="doublequote">Mistake in Heaven</title>, <title render="doublequote">Teacher Story</title>, <title render="doublequote">Eyes in the Twilight</title>, <title render="doublequote">Against the Wind</title>, <title render="doublequote">I Went To the Store,</title> <title render="doublequote">Girl Marriage,</title> <title render="doublequote">Chicken Story</title>, <title render="doublequote">The Last Snow</title>, <title render="doublequote">Pie Supper</title>, and <title render="doublequote">London Copy</title>. Some may exist under other titles or correspond to later novels (as <title render="doublequote">The Hunter </title>corresponds to <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn</title>). In the margins, Arnow made notations like <title render="doublequote">pulp</title> alongside the stories <title render="doublequote">Mountain Woman </title>and <title render="doublequote">She Hated Him</title> and <title render="doublequote">juvenile</title> alongside <title render="doublequote">Pie Supper.</title> Pages containing addresses have been photocopied and placed with <title render="doublequote">Addresses</title> in <title render="doublequote">Personal Notes</title> folder (Box 126, Folder 14).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
