While other manuscripts from Harriette Arnow may contain chapters fragments (see <title render="italic">Old Burnside</title>), these fragments are difficult, if not impossible, to place. Furthermore, because the books rely on the same resource materials as explained below, the fragments were often difficult to differentiate between manuscripts (both between versions of the same manuscript and between <title render="italic">Seedtime</title> and <title render="italic">Flowering</title>). The sections of this part of the collection can be broken into three main categories: Research Materials, <title render="italic">Seedtime on the Cumberland </title>manuscript, and <title render="italic">Flowering of the Cumberland</title> manuscript. With the other manuscripts, if any research materials existed, they were placed with only that manuscript. For the social histories, the research material has been combined. The reasoning behind this is that the resources for the books often overlap, as Arnow commented. On June 6, 1962, Harriette Arnow sent a letter to Mrs. [Gertrude] Parsley for the official business of requesting permission for materials (General Correspondence). <title render="doublequote">You have no doubt been made awre [sic] many times through the years that I am working on a manuscript concerned with pioneer days on the Cumberland, a part of which was published in 1960 under the title <title render="italic">Seedtime on the Cumberland</title>. I am now in the final stages of preparing another, tentatively titled, <title render="italic">The Cumberland in Bloom</title> for possible publication in late 1963.</title> Later in the letter Arnow continues, "This second manuscript is more in the nature of a companion piece to <title render="italic">Seedtime</title> than a squel [sic], and thus makes use of much the same sources." Arnow did not intend for the research materials for the books to be separated.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1713" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1768" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1780" level="subseries"/> </c>
