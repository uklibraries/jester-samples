Knopf. The many versions and variants of <title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter</title> arrived at the University of Kentucky in complete disarray. With a few exceptions, pages were not in sequential order, and different versions and different formats (original typescript, carbon, and photocopies) were mixed together. Although certain pages apparently follow in sequence, it was not always clear with which version a fragment belonged. Moreover, many pages were missing. Arnow often used the reverse side of apparently discarded pages from one work to type something else. For example, the reverse sides of pages from <title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter</title> were used to type parts of <title render="italic">Kentucky Trace</title>, <title render="doublequote">A Tumor Tale,</title> and various correspondences. In these cases, the original was photocopied, and the photocopy was put with the appropriate part of <title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter</title>, and the original was left with the material where it was found. </p> <p>In an attempt to make the many fragments of the novel more accessible, the manuscript fragments were grouped as Early Drafts, Middle Drafts, Later Drafts, and Typesetters Drafts. These drafts were then sorted into versions. It must be emphasized that the arrangement into versions does not necessarily represent Arnow's own order or sequence, and she certainly did not call the versions Early Draft, Middle Draft, etc. Rather the parts were pieced together by an educated guess at what their original and appropriate order might have been. In cases where one sequence of pages might follow another sequence but the thread between the parts could not be established clearly, the sequences were kept separate, but a note was made about their probable link. It is quite possible that Arnow did not think of these sequences as integral versions but rather as reworkings of a particular part of the novel. Some versions represent only a chapter or small portion of the novel because a definite link to another sequence could not be determined. Where possible, an indication of the rough correspondence between the fragmented versions and the published version has been given. Arnow worked on the manuscript over many years. Early Version B.1, p. 55 has the following note: <title render="doublequote">begun writing Dec. 5 here, 1963--typed Feb. 19, 64</title> [sic]. Harold Strauss formally accepted the manuscript for publication by Alfred A. Knopf in his letter of July 7, 1967, but it was not until November 13, 1969 after the manuscript had undergone extensive revision that he was able to send Arnow the first copy of <title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter</title> to come off the press. The Knopf correspondence deals with the editing and revision of the novel (See Box 31, Folders 8-9, and Box 32, Folder 1). An indication of the extent of the revisions is the fact that one of the early typed versions (Early Draft, Version E.2) has pages numbered to 1073, but the typesetter's version contains 614 pages. In his letter of March 28, 1968, written after he received the last 300 pages of the novel, Strauss asks Arnow to submit again an earlier version of the manuscript. His letter of April 19, 1968 indicates that the editors are reading the two versions of the novel. It appears that the editors decided on the shorter version. In the Middle Draft versions, the novel has assumed a general shape close to the published version. It appears from some of the file folders in which the manuscript was kept that Arnow at some point called the manuscript <title render="doublequote">Ter</title> and <title render="doublequote">Light My Fire</title>. Roman numeral chapter numbers were given by Arnow.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1275" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1298" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1331" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1389" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1489" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1548" level="item"/> </c>
