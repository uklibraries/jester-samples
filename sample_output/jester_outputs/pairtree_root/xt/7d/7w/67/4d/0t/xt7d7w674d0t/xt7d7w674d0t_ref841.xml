Since Arnow did not number the notebooks, we have no way of knowing the order in which the story was written. Therefore, the notebooks have been arranged according to their correspondence with the published first edition. This arrangement is based on the correspondence of the beginning of the notebook to the published first edition. It must be stressed that this was not Arnow's ordering and almost certainly does not represent the order in which the story was written. Box 68 contains 4 notebooks relating to the story, but which contain no real correspondence to the published first edition. Page numbers and notebook numbers in brackets represent our numbering not Arnow's. When a photocopy has been provided, the original should not be used due to its delicate condition.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref842" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref853" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref862" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref874" level="subseries"/> </c>
