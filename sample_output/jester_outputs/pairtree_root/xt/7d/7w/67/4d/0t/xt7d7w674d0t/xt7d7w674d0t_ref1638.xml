Heavily edited, with several cut-and-paste sections and comments by an outside reader, usually pertaining to medical issues (presumably Dr. Kahn). Draft includes four handwritten pages, probably unconnected to each other, of preliminary drafts. Draft of Section II, titled <title render="doublequote">Part II Decrepitude</title>, p. 1-47, missing p. 3 and 5. Self-edited, with many cuts suggested in pencil.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
