Some light editing. In this 10 page autobiographical essay Arnow discusses her impressions of living simply in Pulaski County, noting that, while she and Harold had found many joys in the rustic life, they had found little of the simplicity. The various demands of attending to a household and farm are discussed, as are county politics, relations with neighbors, local gossip, and the Works Progress Administration. The essay is in fragile condition; a photocopy is provided as a user copy.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
