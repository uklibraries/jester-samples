Aside from letters, the pair sent one another gifts, including stamps, sea shells, maps, and a boomerang. Their correspondence began in 1957 when Bickhoff wrote a short letter (see August 12, 1957 letter) to Arnow saying he enjoyed reading the condensed version of her book in <title render="italic">Reader's Digest</title> and hoped to read more of her work in the future. Bickhoff is a cowboy and groom who worked in various places during the course of the correspondence. Letters are conversational but formal. Most of the early letters discuss farming, gardening, and the weather. Later letters discuss family events, politics, the Vietnam War, and other major world events. Includes newspaper articles, discussion of sheep, animal diseases, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Cuban crisis, doctors, Apollo 13, Richard Nixon, Watergate, Labour Government, Cambodia, Aborigines, Angola, Ronald Reagan, 1984 Olympics, AIDS, rising costs, and whether the Arnows want to continue country life.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref491" level="file"/> <c id="ref492" level="file"/> <c id="ref493" level="file"/> <c id="ref494" level="file"/> <c id="ref495" level="file"/> <c id="ref496" level="file"/> </c>
