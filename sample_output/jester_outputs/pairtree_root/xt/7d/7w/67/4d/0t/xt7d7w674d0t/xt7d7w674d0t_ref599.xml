No conclusion can be made as to whether this typescript reflected HSA's final intentions or was ready to be offered in whole to a publisher. Judging solely from a textual standpoint -- taking into consideration the numerous editorial marks, page misnumberings, chapter misnumberings or omissions and several loose pages -- this does not appear to be a finished work. To present a legible version, original carbons co-mingle with photocopies. Rather than correct obvious mistakes in page and chapter numberings through renumbering, such discrepancies are noted below for the reader's information. In chapter numbering, HSA mixed Roman and Arabic numerals. For the sake of consistency with the final typescript, Roman numerals have been adopted in the following inventory. It appears that <title render="italic">Belle</title> never underwent editing beyond the expected authorial revision. However, it appears that HSA's daughter Marcella attempted to work on the Typescript Version after her mother's death. This attempt can result in some confusion. In Chapter IX, for instance, there is a glut of corrections made in pen using signs (such as question marks) that HSA never used in revising her own work. We have no indication that HSA dictated these changes nor would they seem to follow any editorial rationale. In addition, Marcella Arnow photocopied pages of the typescript. In the process, she wrote OBS (short for obsolete) in pen on pages she believed were merely carbons, superfluous to the Typescript Version. Unfortunately, several of those pages were not carbons but pages that filled gaps in the typescript. Several other marked pages were far clearer than the photocopies, necessitating their use in the Typescript Draft or Typescript Version boxes. Simply put, the reader should not misinterpret OBS as a directive or note by HSA.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref600" level="file"/> <c id="ref601" level="file"/> <c id="ref602" level="file"/> <c id="ref603" level="file"/> <c id="ref604" level="file"/> <c id="ref605" level="file"/> <c id="ref606" level="file"/> <c id="ref607" level="file"/> <c id="ref608" level="file"/> <c id="ref609" level="file"/> <c id="ref610" level="file"/> <c id="ref611" level="file"/> <c id="ref612" level="file"/> <c id="ref613" level="file"/> <c id="ref614" level="file"/> </c>
