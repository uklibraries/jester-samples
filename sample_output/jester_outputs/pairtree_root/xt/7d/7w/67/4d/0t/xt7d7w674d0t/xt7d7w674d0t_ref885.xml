Early Draft, Version D.4 appears to be a handwritten draft of Early Draft, Version D.3. Early Draft, Version F.1, F.2, F.3, G.1, and G.2 include versions of early chapters that were not included in the published version. Early Draft, Version G.2 appears to be a handwritten draft of Early Draft, Version G.1. Early Draft, Versions H.1 and I.1 appear to be handwritten drafts of book Chapters 34 and 12, respectively. Early Draft, Version J.1 (p. 50-408) appears to be the earliest, relatively complete version of the manuscript. It has little correspondence to the published version. Early Draft, Version K.1 includes a version of book Chapter 9 that appears to have been written between Early Draft, Versions J.1 and L.1. Early Draft, Version L.1 (p. 1-403) has more correspondence to published version than Early Draft, Version J.1. Early Draft, Version M.1 (p. 1-408) could possibly be the carbon of Early Draft, Version L.1. However, the first page of every chapter is different. Many pages have been renumbered, sometimes more than once. Many pages contain handwritten notes on back of page. Child's scribbling is also common throughout the manuscript. When a photocopy has been provided, the original should not be used due to its delicate condition. Roman numeral and quoted chapter headings were given by Arnow.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref886" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref914" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref935" level="subseries"/> </c>
