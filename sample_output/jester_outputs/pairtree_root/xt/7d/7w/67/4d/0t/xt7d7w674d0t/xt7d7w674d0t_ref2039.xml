It consists of prints, negatives, slides and postcards. Comprised in the series are family snapshots, publicity head shots, photographs from writing workshops and occasions when Arnow won awards, photographs collected by Arnow for research purposes for <title render="italic">Seedtime on the Cumberland</title> and <title render="italic">Flowering of the Cumberland</title>, and photos from Arnow's funeral. There are also portraits of three authors, James Dickey, William Styron, and Tennessee Williams, that were taken for inclusion in <title render="italic">Images of the Southern Writer</title> by Mark Morrow, 1985. Arnow is not included in the book, although Morrow corresponded with her (see March 2, 1981 letter, Box 37, Folder 18) and he sent her the images of the other authors. </p> <p>The majority of the photographs are family snapshots of Harriette, her husband Harold, her son Tom and her daughter Marcella taken mostly in Michigan. There are several photographs of the family when they lived in a World War II housing project in Detroit and also several shots of the family at their home on Nixon Road in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many of the photos feature Harriette and the children, and seem to have been taken by Harold. Also included in this series are photographs of Harriette's mother, sisters, brother, and other relatives on her side. </p> <p>There are not many photographs that appear to have been taken in Kentucky, excluding Arnow's funeral. Arnow died in 1986 and she was cremated. Her ashes were buried next to Harold's grave in Keno. Harold died the previous year, February 20, 1985. The urn with her remains and the placing of the urn in the woods are documented in these photos.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref2040" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2080" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2087" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2091" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2324" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2347" level="subseries"/> </c>
