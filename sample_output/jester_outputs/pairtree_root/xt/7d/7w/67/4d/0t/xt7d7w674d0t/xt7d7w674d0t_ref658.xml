This arrangement does not necessarily represent Arnow's own order or sequence, and she certainly did not refer to them as Version 1, Version 2, etc. Some versions represent only a small portion of the novel. Where possible, an indication of the rough correspondence between the versions and the published first edition has been noted. Both Version 1 and Version 2 correspond roughly to Chapters 1-18 in published first edition. Version 1 is longer and appears to have been written first. Version 2 corresponds to the published version more closely that Version 1 in most cases. Of the four versions, Version 3 corresponds most closely to the published version. Version 4 appears to be part of an earlier version submitted to Cecil Scott, Arnow's editor at Macmillan, and some correspondence to the published version is apparent. </p> <p>Some character names change from the earlier versions to the published version. Most notably, the Murphys become the Dalys and Mr. Hoard becomes Mr. Flint. Also included are the publisher's page proofs, pre-publication review copy, and galley sheets. Arnow worked on the manuscript for several years. In a letter to Charles Cunningham (Editor-in-Chief of the Trade Department, Macmillan) dated October 26, 1952, Arnow stated that she had been working on this manuscript for about four years (since before <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn </title>was published) and that she had thought about parts of it for twenty years. Arnow's struggles with this manuscript were compounded by the efforts of Cecil Scott. Between the revisions written by Scott and his suggested cuts, little of Arnow's original manuscript remained. Arnow finally finished the manuscript with the help of Granville Hicks, her editor for <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn</title>. Correspondence between Hicks and Arnow deals with the editing and revision of the manuscript, as well as the situation involving Scott. These letters include corrections suggested by Hicks and corrections submitted by Arnow as well as their personal anecdotes (See Box 31, Folder 5). It appears that Arnow often referred to the manuscript as <title render="doublequote">The doll </title>and <title render="doublequote">Gertie</title>. Roman numeral chapter numbers were given by Arnow. </p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref659" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref734" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref811" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref829" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref838" level="file"/> <c id="ref839" level="item"/> </c>
