      <p>John George Cawelti (1929-2022), scholar of literature and popular culture and professor of English at the University of Kentucky, was born on December 31, 1929, in Evanston Illinois.  He served in the United States Army from 1952-1954, attaining the rank of First Lieutenant.  He received his BA from Oberlin College in 1951 and his MA and PhD from the University of Iowa (1956 and 1960, respectively).  A founding scholar in the study of popular culture writing as literature, Cawelti was on the faculty at the University of Chicago from 1957-1980  and the University of Kentucky (UK) from 1980 to 2000.  During his career at UK, he was awarded the William S. Ward Prize for Distinguished Service to the English Department, 1993; the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professorship, 1994; the UK Chancellor's Award for Outstanding Teaching; and Arts and Sciences Outstanding Teacher.  A prolific author, his publications include <title render="italic">Apostles of the Self-Made Man</title> (1965); <title render="italic">The Six-Gun Mystique</title> (1970, second edition 1984); <title render="italic">Why Pop?</title> (1973); <title render="italic">Adventure, Mystery, and Romance: Formula Stories as Art and Popular Culture</title> (1976); <title render="italic">The Spy Story</title> (1987); <title render="italic">The Six-Gun Mystique Sequel</title> (1999); and <title render="italic">Mystery, Violence, and Popular Culture</title> (2004). Cawelti co-founded the Popular Culture Association, which annually presents the John G. Cawelti Award for the best scholarly text that advances  the study of popular and American culture.  In 1996, he was presented with the Award for Outstanding Service to American Culture Studies by the Governing Board of the American Culture Association.  Cawelti was married to Elizabeth Offringa and Mary Catherine Flannery.  His children include stepsons Jon Fasanelli-Cawelti, Jonathan Flannery, and Benjamin Flannery; and children Brent Cawelti and Andrea Cawelti.

      <p>The John G. Cawelti papers (dated 1967-2021, undated; 2 cubic feet; 2 record storage cartons) primarily comprise research materials, writings and speeches, correspondence, class materials, biographical information, and printed material documenting the scholarly work of English professor and scholar John G. Cawelti.  The research material includes notebooks and various editions with underlines and notes for a group research project on <title render="italic">Ulysses</title> by James Joyce with Robert Olsen, Art Whobel, and Michael Lannon.  The writings and speeches include drafts, proofs, review drafts, reprints and printed publications, and a series of typescripts and lists of works for a potential book of essays.  The class materials comprise the syllabus, readings, and exam questions for a 1967 class on the western novel that Cawelti co-taught with Norman Maclean at the University of Chicago.  The biographical material includes a curriculum vitae, a 1989 photograph album and scrapbook, and monographs inscribed to Cawelti.  There is also a memorial album of Cawelti's National Humanities Faculty visit to Baltimore City College in June 1971 that includes drawings of participants by Olin L. Yoder and associated handwritten notes from individuals; a brochure for prospective students of The College at the University of Chicago (undated); and a 1967 publication from Frumious Press in Chicago, <emph render="doublequote">CHARACTERS/ or witty descriptions of the properties of Sundry Persons/ Drawn from the pen of Sir Thomas Overbury.</emph></p>
