      <p>No biographical information available on diary author.</p><p>The American Express Cruise Around the World was initiated in 1922 by the American Express Company to be the first ever continuous circumnavigation of the globe by a passenger liner. Its intention was to visit the waters first explored by Magellan's fleet during his circumnavigation of the globe some 400-years earlier. The initial voyage began on November 1922 and the company chartered Cunard's Laconia for the 130-day voyage. The Second Cruise Around the World, lasting from 1923 to 1924, chartered the Franconia, also from Cunard, and is the subject of this diary.</p><p>American Letters collector Wade Hall (1934-2015) was a native of Union Springs, Alabama.  Starting in 1962, he lived in Louisville, where he taught English and chaired the English and Humanities/Arts programs at Kentucky Southern College and Bellarmine University.  He also taught at the University of Illinois and the University of Florida.  He held degrees from Troy State University (B.S.), the University of Alabama (M.A.), and the University of Illinois (Ph.D.). He served for two years in the U.S. Army in the mid-fifties. Dr. Hall was the author of books, monographs, articles, plays, and reviews relating to Kentucky, Alabama, and Southern history and literature.  His most recent books include <title render="italic">A Visit with Harlan Hubbard</title>; <title render="italic">High Upon a Hill: A History of Bellarmine College</title>; <title render="italic">A Song in Native Pastures: Randy Atcher's Life in Country Music</title>; and <title render="italic">Waters of Life from Conecuh Ridge</title>.</p>
