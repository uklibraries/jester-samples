      <p>David Anthony Spaeth (September 11, 1941-January 6, 1995) was a former faculty member in the College of Architecture at the University of Kentucky (UK). He was born in Zanesville, Ohio, and spent childhood summers travelling to northern Wisconsin to visit his maternal grandparents. These trips would take him through Chicago, Illinois, where he was fascinated by two buildings at 860 and 880 Lakeshore Drive, both designed by German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Spaeth later enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Chicago in 1959, where Mies was serving as Dean, and acquire both a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Architecture. Mies mentored Spaeth and became a prominant subject of study for much of Spaeth's professional work; Mies and the Chicago School architectural style were common themes in many of Spaeth's publications and lectures. </p><p>Before starting his academic career at UK in Lexington, Kentucky, Spaeth worked breifly as an architect in Lubbock, Texas. There, he married Gail Addison Smith in 1967. The couple shared two sons, Anthony and Sloan.</p><p>In the fall of 1969, Spaeth took an assistant professor position with the School of Architecture, which later became the College of Architecture in 1970. He was promoted to associate professor with tenure in 1973, then professor with tenure in 1985. In July 0f 1985, he took a leave in order to serve as a visiting professor for the University of Florida, Gainesville for the 1985-1986 academic year. Throughout his time at UK, Spaeth was also an active member of the Lexington community, taking on many projects focused on preservation, mostly renovations, for downtown neighborhoods. It is likely the last semester he taught was Spring semester of 1993. He passed away in Lexington, Kentucky on January 6, 1995.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>0000ua282: Minutes of the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, 1969-09-16 (p. 33).
