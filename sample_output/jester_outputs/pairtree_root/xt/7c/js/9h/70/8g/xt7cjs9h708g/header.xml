      <p>Before the outbreak of the Civil War, George W. Gallup (1828-1880) was a student, teacher, and lawyer. Originally from New York, he  migrated to Kentucky where he would meet his future wife, Rebecca, and become close friends with her brother, Laban T. Moore. In December 1861, Gallup and Moore rallied men together to form the 14th Kentucky Volunteer Infantry and he initially served as its quartermaster. He later became its commander. He served as Commander of the Military District of Eastern Kentucky from August 1863 to May 1864. Two months prior to the beginning of the diary, Gallup joined General William Tecumseh Sherman's command during the Atlanta campaign. After the end of the war, Gallup resumed his law practice in Louisa, Kentucky. In recognition of his Civil War service, President Andrew Johnson appointed him Brevet Brigadier General in 1867. He died in 1880 and is buried in Ashland, Kentucky.</p>

      <p>The George W. Gallup Civil War diary (dated 1864; 0.05 cubic feet; 1 folder) consists of one diary that documents Gallup's journey to Atlanta as a lieutenant colonel in the Union Army under General Sherman during the Atlanta campaign. The diary begins on July 10, 1864, in which he notes having 2000 miles to go until reaching Atlanta. In the days leading up to the Atlanta campaign, Gallup discusses troop movements, journeying through Macon and Jonesborough, and utilizing the railways. There is heavy detail regarding the day of the Atlanta campaign and the days following. After partaking in the campaign, he concludes his diary in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on his way home to Kentucky. The diary is in fragile condition and should be handled carefully.</p>
