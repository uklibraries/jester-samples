      <p>Hollis Summers was born on June 21, 1916, in Eminence, Kentucky, to Hollis Spurgeon Summers Sr., and Hazel Holmes Summer. After graduating from high school in Madisonville, Kentucky, Summers went on to complete a bachelor's degree at Georgetown College (1937), a master's at the Bread Loaf School of English at Middlebury College in Vermont (1943), and a doctorate at the University of Iowa (1948). He began a teaching career at Holmes High School in Convington, Kentucky. He also taught at Georgetown College for five years and at the University of Kentucky for ten years. Among his students at UK were notable Kentucky writers Wendell Berry, Gurney Norman, James Baker Hall, Ed McClanahan, and Bobbie Ann Mason. Summers was voted UK's College of Fine Arts Distinguished Professor of the Year in 1959. Also in 1959, he left UK for Ohio University, where he spent the remainder of his teaching career before retiring in 1986. Summers died on November 14, 1987, and is buried at the Millersburg Cemetery in Bourbon County, Kentucky. In 1997, the Ohio University Press began the Hollis Summers Poetry Prize competition, which awards winners with a cash prize and publication by the Ohio University Press.</p><p>Summers wrote and published numerous novels, short stories, and poetry collections throughout his life. The conflict between religion and romantic love is a common theme in Summers' writing, and many of his works are set in Kentucky. His published novels include <title render="italic">City Limit</title> (1948), <title render="italic">Brighten the Corner</title> (1952), <title render="italic">The Weather of February</title> (1957), <title render="italic">The Day After Sunday</title> (1968), and <title render="italic">The Garden</title> (1972). He also co-authored <title render="italic">Teach You a Lesson</title> (1956) with Jim Rouake under the pseudonym Jim Hollis. Summers began publishing poetry collections around the time he moved to Ohio, including <title render="italic">The Walks Near Athens</title> (1959), <title render="italic">Someone Else</title> (1962), <title render="italic">The Peddler and Other Domestic Matters</title> (1967), <title render="italic">Occupant Please Forward</title> (1976), <title render="italic">Dinosaurs</title> (1977), and <title render="italic">After the Twelve Days</title> (1987).</p><p>Sources:
