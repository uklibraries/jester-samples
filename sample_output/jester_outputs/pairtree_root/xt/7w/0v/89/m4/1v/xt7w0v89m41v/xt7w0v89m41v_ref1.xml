The names were written in calligraphy (World War II) by engineering professor John Sherman Horine or in calligraphy or lettered in print (Korean War, Vietnam War, and conflicts from 1975-2006). For each war or conflict, names are organized by county and then in alphabetical order within each county. Some of the item numbers are not in consecutive order because of how the panels were received from the construction crews removing the panels.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref2" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref27" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref33" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref38" level="subseries"/> </c>
