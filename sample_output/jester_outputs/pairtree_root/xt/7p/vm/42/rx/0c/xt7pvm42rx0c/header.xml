          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Composer, Performer, and Author. Niles was born in Louisville in 1892. Coming from a musical family, Niles began to play the dulcimer at an early age. As a teenager he worked with a surveying team in eastern Kentucky. During this time he kept a notebook in which he recorded lyrics and music of old folk songs known in the area. Niles served as a U.S. Army pilot in World War I and made numerous reconnaissance flights until he suffered serious injuries in a plane crash. After the war he studied music at the University of Lyon and the Schola Cantorium in Paris. Niles completed his musical education at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. He renewed his search for folk songs in Appalachia as he accompanied noted photographer Doris Ulmann on her travels through the mountain region. He set traditional songs in new arrangements and composed many original songs.</p>

There are also original photographs taken at the 1903 launching of Orville and Wilbur Wright's airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

        <p>John Jacob Niles' creative works including music compositions, books, prose, poetry, radio programs, articles, and plays comprise the Manuscript series.</p>
        <p>The Music manuscript subseries is comprised of twenty-nine boxes of original manuscripts and published music. These works are categorized according to the instrument for which they are written and arranged alphabetically in each category. Differing slightly in arrangement from the rest of the series is the Niles-Merton Song Cycle. Though originally written for solo voice and piano, there are also choral arrangements of some of these songs. Consequently, the entire work is arranged alphabetically by song title so that all versions of a song may be found together. Untitled works and incomplete sketches are described at the close of the series.</p>
        <p>The Books manuscript subseries consists of 45 boxes of manuscripts divided into five subseries and arranged chronologically. The series includes Song My Mother Never Taught Me, a collection of World War I Army songs, The Ballad Book. Niles' most widely acclaimed literary effort; and his unfinished Autobiography. Correspondence and other related materials are filed within each subseries.</p>
        <p>The Plays manuscript subseries consists of seven boxes. The material is arranged chronologically. Those manuscripts which are undated are listed alphabetically. The radio programs manuscript series consists of two boxes. This material is arranged chronologically by broadcast date. Most notable in this series are the radio programs entitled <title render="doublequote">Salute to the Hills.</title> These programs, prepared by John Jacob Niles, were a part of the University of Kentucky's experiment in directed broadcasting.</p>
        <p>The Articles manuscript subseries consists of two boxes of magazine and newspaper articles by John Jacob Niles. This material is arranged chronologically. The miscellaneous manuscript series consists of three boxes. Contained in this series are typed and handwritten notes, reflections, and observations by John Jacob Niles in the form of prose and poetry.</p>
