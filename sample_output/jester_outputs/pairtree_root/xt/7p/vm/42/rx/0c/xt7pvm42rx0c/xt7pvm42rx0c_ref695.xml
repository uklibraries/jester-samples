These works are categorized according to the instrument for which they are written and arranged alphabetically in each category. Differing slightly in arrangement from the rest of the series is the Niles-Merton Song Cycle. Though originally written for solo voice and piano, there are also choral arrangements of some of these songs. Consequently, the entire work is arranged alphabetically by song title so that all versions of a song may be found together. Untitled works and incomplete sketches are described at the close of the series.</p> <p>The Books manuscript subseries consists of 45 boxes of manuscripts divided into five subseries and arranged chronologically. The series includes Song My Mother Never Taught Me, a collection of World War I Army songs, The Ballad Book. Niles' most widely acclaimed literary effort; and his unfinished Autobiography. Correspondence and other related materials are filed within each subseries.</p> <p>The Plays manuscript subseries consists of seven boxes. The material is arranged chronologically. Those manuscripts which are undated are listed alphabetically. The radio programs manuscript series consists of two boxes. This material is arranged chronologically by broadcast date. Most notable in this series are the radio programs entitled <title render="doublequote">Salute to the Hills.</title> These programs, prepared by John Jacob Niles, were a part of the University of Kentucky's experiment in directed broadcasting.</p> <p>The Articles manuscript subseries consists of two boxes of magazine and newspaper articles by John Jacob Niles. This material is arranged chronologically. The miscellaneous manuscript series consists of three boxes.
