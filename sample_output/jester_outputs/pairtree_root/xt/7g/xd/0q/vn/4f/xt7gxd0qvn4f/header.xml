          <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Pradyumna <emph render="doublequote">Paul</emph> <emph render="doublequote">P.P.</emph> Prasad Karan (1930-2018) was among the first non-Western, international, person of color tenure-track faculty member at the University of Kentucky. Born to a working class family in Gaya, India, Karan excelled at education, earning his Bachelor's degree with honors in Economics from Patna University and a Masters degree in Geography from Banaras Hindu University. After visiting the United States for the 1952 International Geographical Conference, Karan decided to pursue his PhD at Indiana University, which he completed in 1956. After graduation he joined the geography department at the University of Kentucky from 1956 to 2017, serving as department chair from 1967-1975 where he oversaw the development of the graduate program in geography. Karan was heavily invested in researching the social and environmental changes in Himalayan mountains, extensively traveling and making connections among the various peoples and governments of the region, which took him to Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, and Tibet. Another key research area was in the history of the discipline of geography in the 20th century. In addition to his leadership in the department of geography, Karan played key roles at the University Press of Kentucky, the Japan Studies program, and the Indian Studies minor. In 2010 he was awarded the University Research Professor by the University of Kentucky and the  Distinguished Scholar Award from the Asia Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers. Karan passed away after a brief illness in 2018, leaving behind his wife Hazel Karan and nephew Madhu Sudan.</p>

      <p>The Pradyumna P. Karan Papers (dated 1909-2016, undated, bulk 1956-2012, undated; 9.32 cubic feet, 3.63 Gigabytes; 4 record storage cartons, 3 document boxes, 6 photograph boxes, 10 flat boxes, 5 oversize folders, 32 cans of film, 3 audio reels, and 1330 electronic files) comprise administrative and grant records, correspondence and conference material, course materials, writings and speeches, biographical information and honors and awards, research notes and subject files, printed materials, maps, photographs, slides, and film documenting Pradyumna Prasad Karan's career as a cultural geographer, administrator, and faculty member in the Department of Geography at the University of Kentucky. The maps include manuscript maps of India, the Indian Himalayas (formerly known as Sikkim), Nepal, and Japan that were collected, created, and annotated by Karan, particularly maps of Sikkim Bazars. The still and moving images were taken by Karan of his fieldwork in the Himalayas, including the countries of Nepal, Bhutan, the Indian Himalayas, and Tibet, and include scenes of people, buildings, and landscapes. Included are two films created from footage Karan took in Bhutan and Sikkim, <title render="italic">A Kingdom in the Clouds: Bhutan</title> (1965) and <title render="italic">Where the Mountains are God: Sikkim</title> (1968).  The printed material includes publications from and about Tibet, Bhutan, China, India and Sikkim, and the Himalaya. The correspondence documents Karan's national and international connections across the discipline of geography from the mid-1970s to the 1990s. Also included are papers related to geographer G. Etsel Pearcy and photographs of Bhutan by geographer David Zurick.  The collection contains little textual information from before 1967. There is also sparse information about Karan's time as department chair from 1967-1975.</p>

        <p>This series contains two films created from footage Karan took in Bhutan and Sikkim, <title render="italic">A Kingdom in the Clouds: Bhutan</title> (1965) and <title render="italic">Where the Mountains are God: Sikkim</title> (1968). There is no complete show print for <title render="italic">Where the Mountains are God: Sikkim</title>.

Subseries B (B-roll and outtakes) comprises B-roll, outtakes, and drafts for these films. Subseries C comprises 35 mm film, while Subseries D includes audio recordings and magnetic film.
