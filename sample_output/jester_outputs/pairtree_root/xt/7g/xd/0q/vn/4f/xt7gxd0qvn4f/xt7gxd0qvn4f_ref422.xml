The report included fieldwork photographs with captions. The list of captions can be found in the first folder of this subseries. The archivist matched the photographs found in the Fractional Numbers Photographs Subseries (Subseries C) with the captions to create the Captioned Bhutan Photographs subseries. These captioned photographs may also be used as a proxy to navigate the full Fractional Numbers Photographs Subseries. For example, Photo 1 (Paro Valley) has a fractional code of 3/1. The other photographs labeled with the number 3/1 are generally about Paro Valley even though they are not captioned as such.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref423" level="file"/> <c id="ref424" level="file"/> <c id="ref460" level="file"/> <c id="ref517" level="file"/> <c id="ref542" level="file"/> </c>
