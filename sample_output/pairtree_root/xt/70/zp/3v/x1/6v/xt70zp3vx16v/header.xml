      <p>Liam O'Flaherty (1896-1984) was an Irish author known for writing novels, plays and short stories during the period of Irish literary renaissance following Irish independence in 1921. O'Flaherty chose to write about controversial subjects, such as war, famine, independence, and religion, and five of his works were censored by the Irish Censorship of Publications Board. The first novel to be censored in Ireland was O'Flaherty's novel <title render="italic">The House of Gold</title>, in 1930.</p>
