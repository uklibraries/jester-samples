      <p>The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce, orginally known as Young Men's Progressive Civic Association (YMPCA) was founded on October 13, 1915 by Henry Giessenbier Jr. in St. Louis, Missouri. The association's goal was to support young men, through leadership and business training, to improve civic issues. In 1916, the association changed its name to the Junior Chamber of Commerce, after affiliating with the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. In the 1920s and 1930s the organizaton grew nationwide through involvement in voter registration and aviation campaigns. The Louisville chapter of the Kentucky Junior Chamber of Commerce, known as Kentucky Jaycees, formed in 1935. During the twentieth century the  Kentucky Jaycees organized chapters throughout the state by region or city and annually held statewide meetings. Each chapter was structured with presidents, officers, and members who volunteered in community service projects.</p><p>Materials in the collection were donated by former Kentucky Jaycee President, Bill McCann, and most often relate to his active years during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Before becoming President, Bill McCann directed the Kentucky statewide Jaycee <title render="italic">Jesse Stuart Book Project</title>. The goal of the project was to distribute a copy of Kentucky author, Jesse Stuart's book <title render="italic">A Penny's Worth of Character</title> to every single sixth grader in the state. According to project reports in the collection, during 1987-1988 the Kentucky Jaycees successfully sent the book to 33,739 students.   </p>

      <p>The Kentucky Jaycees records (dated 1937-1995, undated; 3.9 cubic feet; 9 boxes) comprise organizational reports, letters, instructional books, magazines, newsletters and other documents of the Kentucky chapters of the Junior Chamber of Commerce primarily from the 1980s and early 1990s. This collection was generated or collected by William McCann in his role as President of the Winchester, Kentucky Jaycees and as historian of the Kentucky Chapter. The collection includes a Bluegrass region Jaycee's scrapbook (1989-1990), a scrapbook documenting the Jessie Stuart book project (1987-1988), correspondence 1988-1994, membership lists, planning guides, newsletters, pamphlets, and minutes of the Board of Directors of the Kentucky Junior Chamber of Commerce, 1940-1950. The records include information about specific Kentucky Jaycee chapter projects as well as statewide meetings and memberships. A significant portion of the collection includes letters, project proposals, grant outlines and management details of the Jesse Stuart Book Project. The Kentucky Jaycees records contains newsletters and magazines created by Kentucky chapters, like The Colonel, and also national Jaycee magazines from as early as the 1930s. Awards in the collection, given to former president, Bill McCann during his tenure in the Kentucky Jaycees show the types of skills and accomplishments recognized by chapters and the statewide organization.</p>
