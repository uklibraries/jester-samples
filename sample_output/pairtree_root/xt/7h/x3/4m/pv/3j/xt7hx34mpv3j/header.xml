      <p>Martha Jane Whiteside (nee Livesay), born June 26, 1924 in San Antonio, Texas, was the daughter of United States Army pathologist Harvey R. Livesay. Due to her father's career in the army, she moved around the country with her family living in Hawaii; Washington, D.C.; and New York.  After graduating from Barnard College of Columbia University in 1943, Whiteside worked as both an assistant and a librarian at the University of Kentucky. There, in 1952, she became a founding associate of Anvil Press alongside influential figures Carolyn Hammer (nee Reading), UK's rare book curator, and her husband, artist and typographer Victor Hammer. Anvil Press would eventually become King Library Press, UK's present-day university press. Mrs. Whiteside married University of Kentucky law professor Frederick W. Whiteside, Jr. (1913-2001). </p><p>Whiteside was involved in various Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government projects, from the preservation of Lexington neighborhoods to breaking ground for new housing and business developments. Specifically she served on the Lexington Fayette County Urban Government planning team to idenify grant projects. She kept abreast of district school policies, advocated for the environmental conservation of Kentucky's natural resources, and contributed to numerous community benefits. She served on the board of the Hunter Foundation for Healthcare. The non-profit organization was named for prominent African-American doctors, Dr. John E. Bush and his son Dr. Bush A. Hunter. The organization was later renamed Healthcare of the Bluegrass. Additionally, Whiteside served on the Kentucky Government Council. Whiteside was an active member of the Kentucky chapter of the League of Women Voters, advocating for women's equality and rights on a state and national level.
      Martha Jane Whiteside passed away in 2011.</p>
