          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Charles Fred Riebe, Jr., born on July 25, 1934, in Missoula, Montana, and raised in Chinook, embarked on a remarkable journey marked by his commitment to conservation and education. He pursued his academic endeavors at Northern Montana College and Montana State College, majoring in civil engineering. It was during his college years that Riebe crossed paths with Beverly Hoehn, whom he married in 1956.</p><p>In 1958, Riebe began his professional career as the Assistant Park Engineer at Glacier National Park, where his passion for environmental stewardship began to flourish. His dedication led him to the National Park Service Western regional office in San Francisco in 1963. It was during this time that collaborative efforts between the National Forest Service, National Park Service, and the United States Department of Labor culminated in the development of vocational and educational programs at Civilian Conservation Centers across the nation.</p><p>Riebe's pivotal role unfolded when he was chosen as the inaugural center director of the Great Onyx Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center (GOJCCC), nestled on Flint Ridge within Mammoth Cave National Park, near Cave City, Kentucky. Assuming the directorship on March 5, 1965, Riebe spearheaded the completion and the operation of the center until August 18, 1968. His tenure as Director witnessed the graduation of countless Job Corpsmen.</p><p>In 1968, Riebe transitioned from his directorial duties to pursue further academic endeavors at the University of Maryland and contribute his expertise at the National Parks Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. Eventually, Charles and Beverly established their residence in Colorado, where their shared commitment to environmental conservation continues to resonate.</p><p>Notably, Riebe undertook the task of collecting interviews with numerous early Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center leaders for an oral history project, thereby enriching the collective understanding of the program's inception and evolution. </p><p>Resources:
