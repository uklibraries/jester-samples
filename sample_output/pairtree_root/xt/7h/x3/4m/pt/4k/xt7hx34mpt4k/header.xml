        <p>The Hall family series includes the papers of descendants from Dr. Ebenezer Wright Hall (1783-1865) and Olivia Rich (1812-1881).  The family were early settlers of Mount Clemens, MaComb County, Michigan, a northeast suburb of Detroit. Dr. Hall established a glass factory for manufacturing medical vials and bottles. As early settlers of Mount Clemens, the Hall family owned a significant portion of properties in the city. The doctor's brother, William Ebenezer Hall, a glass cutter, with his wife, Letitia Jenny Shook, helped manage Hall Bath House, a mineral spa and hotel. The couple had two daughters, Nelle Belle, a  school teacher, and Blanche Hall Parrott. Their daughters helped manage the hotel property into the early twentieth century. Blanche's daughter, Thelma Hall Parrott Hollingsworth, was integral to the closing and selling of the Hall estate property in the late 1950's.</p>

        <p>Denzil Maurice Hollingsworth was born in 1900 to Ethelbert and Bertha Piel Hollingsworth in Allison Prairie, Illinois. After serving the United States Army during World War I, Denzil earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois-Urbana/Champaign. While at university, he met another student, Thelma Polly Parrott, and the couple were wed in the Spring of 1921. Denzil and Polly lived at 4211 Flora Place, St. Louis, Missouri, and Polly gave birth to five children: Donn Denzil, Louis Hall, Kent, Dorcas, and Vertrees. Denzil worked as a contractor for his own excavating company and won contracts to begin work for many St. Louis City landmarks like the Kiel Opera House, Malcolm Bliss Hospital, and Kennard School. Denzil also designed mechanisms for oil well drills and invested in wells throughout southern Indiana, Illinois, and various other locations throughout the country. In the late 1930s, Denzil and Thelma followed their dream for race horsing and moved to a farm, originally owned by founders of Keeneland Horse Race Course, Louis and Harriet Beard, in Georgetown, Kentucky. They named the farm <title render="doublequote">The Holly's</title> and raised several champion thoroughbreds there. Denzil died of a sudden heart attack on April 19, 1968.</p>

        <head>Biographical note</head>
        <p>Dorcas Noel Hollingsworth Wiedemann was born on December 28, 1926 to Thelma and Denzil Hollingsworth in Saint Louis, Missouri. She was the only daughter with four brothers. The family moved to central Kentucky in 1936, where Dorcas, with her brother Kent, could ride horses. She attended school at the University of Kentucky and the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College, in New Orleans, Louisiana. After college she moved to New York City to pursue a career as a photographer. She returned to Kentucky and worked as a portrait photographer at Purcell's Department Store. While working she met the son of the owners of Purcell's, Jefferson Wiedemann and the couple wed in 1950. They had five children: Jefferson Mark, Randal, Holly, Britton, and Hope. Jefferson Allen Wiedemann was the great-grandson of George Wiedemann, founder of the Cincinnati brewery, and was the grandson of the J.D. Purcell, founder of the only Lexington downtown department store. Jefferson started his own companies in coal brokerage and marketing. He also invested in many of his father-in-law's oil wells and other ventures. Dorcas and Jefferson lived at Holly's Farm in Georgetown, Kentucky until their deaths in 1986 (Jefferson) and 2015 (Dorcas).</p>

        <head>Scope and Contents</head>
        <p>The Dorcas Noel Hollingsworth and Jefferson Allen Wiedemann, 1916-2003, undated, series contains correspondence, business records, newspaper clippings, and scrapbooks created or received by Dorcas, Jefferson, or their family. The series includes organizational records and genealogical research for the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) by Dorcas. A large portion of the correspondence were love letters sent to Dorcas by soldiers during World War II, before her marriage to Jefferson in 1950. Business records reflect Jefferson's investments in oil with and after the death of his father-in-law, Denzil Hollingsworth.</p>
