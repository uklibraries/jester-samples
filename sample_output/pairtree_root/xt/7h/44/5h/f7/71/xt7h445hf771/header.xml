      <p>Abraham Wikler (1910-1981), researcher in psychopharmacology, neuropharmacology, addiction to opiates, alcohol, and marijuana, and brain-behavior relations, was born on October 12, 1910, in New York, New York. Father Isaac Wikler (1884-1944) and mother Clara B. Wortman (1891-1966) were born in Poland, lived in Austria, and immigrated to the United States between 1903 and 1907. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School (New York, New York) in 1927.  He received an AB degree from Columbia College (now Columbia University, New York, New York) in 1930 and an MD from Long Island College of Medicine (now the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York) in 1935. </p><p>Following internships between 1935 and 1938 at Montefiore Hospital (New York, NY), Jewish Hospital (Brooklyn, NY), Kingston Avenue Hospital (Brooklyn, NY), and the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Hospital (Stapleton, NY), Wikler was commissioned as an Officer in the United States Public Health Service, serving from 1938 to 1963 in the following roles:  Medical Officer, USPHS Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri (1938-1940); Psychiatric Resident, USPHS Hospital, Lexington, KY (1940-1942); Detached Duty (extramural study in neurophysiology, experimental psychology, and neuropathology) at various American locations (1942-1943); and Experimental Neuropsychiatrist and Associate Director and Chief, Section on Experimental Neuropsychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Addiction Research Center (ARC), Lexington, Kentucky (1943-1963). Between 1959-1960, Wikler was Acting Director and from 1960-1961, he was on Detached Duty (extramural study in neuropharmacology and psychopharmacology) at various European locations.  He received certification in both neurology and psychiatry from the Ameircan Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1944.</p><p>Following his retirement from the USPHS, Wikler was appointed Clinical Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in 1962. His appointment changed to Professor of Psychiatry and Pharmacology in 1963. He became professor emeritus in 1978 until his death on March 7, 1981.</p><p>Wikler published four books and 160 articles.  He was a Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. He was warded the USPHS Meritorious Service Medal, 1963; the Medallion for Distinguished Service to American Medicine by the Alumni Association, State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, 1967; and the National Academy of Sciences Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award for excellence in drug abuse research, 1976.  He was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, CA, 1970-1971.</p><p>Wikler married Ada Fay Fischer (1915-2007) on July 29, 1933, in the Bronx, New York, New York.  They had four children, including Marjorie Wikler Senechal (1938- ), Norma Juliet Wikler Feinberg (1942-2002), Daniel Isaac Wikler (1946- ), and Jean C. Wikler Kazen (1948- ).</p><p>Sources:
