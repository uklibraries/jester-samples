          <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The South East Coal Company operated in a town called Seco in Letcher County, Kentucky from 1915 until 1957. Seco is an acronym for <title render="doublequote">South East Coal Company.</title> Both the town and the company were incorporated in 1915 by A.D. Smith and Harry LaViers of the South East Coal Company, marked by the establishment of a first class post office. However, the town existed prior to the arrival of the South East Coal Company; the coal rights to the land surrounding the town were sold in 1898 according to courthouse records. Oral histories from town residents note that prior to both the town's and the company's incorporation that the river had already been turned, with an office building and three sawmills installed as early as 1905-1910. In addition to their operations at Seco, the company operated a mine and coal camp at the other end of their land holdings called Millstone. Coal Campus USA cites a December 1, 1925 article in <title render="italic">The Coal Trade Bulletin</title> in which the company notably only hired white laborers and <title render="doublequote">never had any labor troubles</title> in the first ten years of its existence. Additionally, the bulletin highlighted how <title render="doublequote">well built, well placed and well maintained</title> the company houses were, that there was not a police force for the town, and that such features demonstrated <title render="doublequote">the character of the management, as well as the congenial conditions which simple discipline creates and maintains.</title> </p><p>Sources: </p><p>Coal Camp USA.
