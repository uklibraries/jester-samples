Karan organized these photographs into sets with Roman numerals. Within the sets, captions for the photographs included the phrase, <title render="doublequote">then and now</title>. These photos are assumed to have been for a proposed publication on change in the Himalaya Mountain environment. There are no <emph render="doublequote">Now</emph> photos present. However, there is a folder of more recent photographs taken by geographer David Zurich. There is some overlap between this Series and the Fieldwork Photographs Series. However, this Series also includes photographs that are not present in the Fieldwork Photographs Series.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref591" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref601" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref626" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref652" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref659" level="subseries"/> </c>
