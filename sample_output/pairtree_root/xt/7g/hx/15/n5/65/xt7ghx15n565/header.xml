          <head>Historical Note</head>
      James Kennedy Patterson (March 26, 1833-August 15, 1922), <emph render="doublequote">The Grand Old Man,</emph>, served from 1869 to 1910 as president of the institutions that were to become the University of Kentucky. Through his vision, diplomatic skills, administrative acumen, and at times, financial support, the fledgling Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M) College of Kentucky was transformed into an independent state university.
      
      Patterson was born in the parish of Gorbals in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1833. His family immigrated to the United States in 1842, when Patterson was nine, and settled near Madison, Indiana. He received his B.A and Master of Arts degrees from Hanover College (Indiana) in 1856 and 1859 respectively, and an honorary Ph.D. from the same institution in 1875. [Later honorary degrees included the LL.D. from the Universities of Vermont (1910) and Kentucky (1916)]. In 1859 he was married to Lucelia Wing, daughter of a wealthy New Bedford, Massachusetts, whaler who had moved to Kentucky around 1800. The Pattersons had two children: daughter, Jeanie Rumsey, who died in infancy and a son, William Andrew (in whose name Patterson by bequest endowed the University's School of Diplomacy), who passed away in 1895 at the age of 27. Following principalships at the Presbyterial Academy of Greenville (Kentucky) and the preparatory department of Stewart College in Clarksville, Tennessee, where he also taught Latin and Greek, he served as Principal of the Transylvania Academy in Lexington from 1861 to 1865.
      
      With the merger in 1865 of Transylvania College (Lexington, Kentucky), Kentucky University (KU, in Harrodsburg, Kentucky), and the newly state-chartered Agricultural and Mechanical College (A&amp;M) of Kentucky, Patterson was appointed professor of Latin and Civil History in this enlarged <emph render="doublequote">Kentucky University.</emph> At the same time, he secured the chair of History and Metaphysics which he occupied under changing institutional auspices until 1910. In 1869, Patterson was elected third Presiding Officer of the University's now constituent Agricultural and Mechanical College. After rancorous denominational and theological bickering and debilitating financial hardship experienced by the hybrid institution, the State Legislature in 1878 formally separated the A&amp;M College from KU, and Patterson assumed the position of <emph render="doublequote">President</emph> of the independent school, called <emph render="doublequote">State College of Kentucky</emph>. One of State College president's first administrative efforts, following the erection of the college's first buildings on its new Lexington Fairgrounds site, ultimately at his own expense, was an attempt to repair the fiscal damage incurred by the school during its preceding thirteen years of existence in linkage with Kentucky University. To this end he led the fight to convince the Kentucky General Assembly to enact legislation establishing a one-half-cent state property tax to raise desperately needed monies to support the struggling College. The climax of his crusade--an impassioned speech on the floor of the Kentucky Senate--succeeded in sweeping away the formidable, organized opposition to the tax and the measure was approved in 1882. The revenues from this new tax, however, proved insufficient to provide for the college's stability and continued growth. With the financial situation of the institution in question, Patterson considered other means of fundraising. When all other options had been exhausted, he secured a personal loan to procure the needed money.
      
      Patterson proved a capable chief executive, administering the daily operations and affairs of the A&amp;M College wisely and economically, although he was criticized by his detractors as unduly tyrannical and miserly, the latter particularly as it related to the salaries of employees and to physical expansion. Many in the community and state likewise felt that the president was wrongly removing the college from its moorings in agricultural and engineering instruction, as mandated by the Morrill Land-Grant Act, and setting it on a course of becoming an essentially liberal arts institution. Increasing curricular diversification led to moves to upgrade the school's official academic classification and Patterson with his Board of Trustees in 1908 successfully lobbied the General Assembly in support of changing the school's name to: <emph render="doublequote">State University, Lexington, Kentucky.</emph> He continued as President for two more years, assisting in the transition of the institution to University status. In 1910 he retired from the presidency. The Board of Trustees unanimously approved his stipulated conditions which included: attendance at Board and faculty meetings; serving as advisor to the incoming President and as representative of the University on the state and national level; and continued residence in the campus house built for the President in 1882, which he occupied until his death in 1922. The life and legacy of Kentucky's <emph render="doublequote">Pater Universitatis</emph> are today honored in University buildings and a roadway that bear his name, and in the seated statue of the founder, erected in 1934, which sits adjacent to the institution's Administration Building and astride the campus he built and nurtured.

The school was named for J.T. Patterson relation to James Kennedy Patterson unknown and appears to have closed circa 1879. The diaries seem to be produced by a group of sisters or relatives with the same last name and account their daily lives. Mention is made within the diaries that they were to serve as writing exercises which would be judged by "Mr. Patterson".</p>
