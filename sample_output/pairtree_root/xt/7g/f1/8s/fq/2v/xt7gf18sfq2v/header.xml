          <head>Biographical</head>
      <p>Donovan Lyle <emph render="doublequote">Lyle</emph> Aten (1927-2017) was a landscape architect who practiced primarily in Kentucky, mainly in Fayette County. Aten was born on February 9, 1927, in Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois.  His parents were Ferrol Glade Aten (1899-1975) and Mary Pauline Bryan Aten (1904-1993). He was mustered into the United States Navy as a seaman second class during World War II, and served as an electrician on board the U.S.S. Bairoko, 1945-1946. He attended Western Illinois University, 1947-1948, and graduated with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Landscape Architecture from University of Illinois in 1951, supported by the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (the <emph render="doublequote">G.I. Bill</emph>). One of his major professors at the University of Illinois was landscape architect Hideo Sasaki. </p><p>After graduating from college, Aten began working for the landscape architecture firm Scruggs and Hammond, Inc., in Peoria, Illinois. John Dudley Scruggs and Clarence E. Hammond established the firm in 1946, specializing in park and recreation planning, land use planning, and regional and urban planning. Their clients included federal, state, and local governments; regional, county, and city planning commissions; developers; and eleemosynary groups. The firm had branch offices in Lexington, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio.  Aten moved to Lexington in 1952 to work out of that office and remained with Scruggs and Hammond for 49 years. During that time, he was promoted to Associate Partner (1954), Principal Partner (1971), Vice President (1972), and President (1974-1993). After formally retiring in 1993, he continued working on landscape architecture projects through 2000. As one of the first landscape architects and landscape architecture practices in Lexington and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky during post-World War II urban and suburban expansion, Aten was involved with residential, commercial, and infrastructure development not only in Kentucky, but also in Ohio and West Virginia. </p><p>With Scruggs and Hammond, Inc., in Lexington and Fayette County, Ky., Aten worked on master planning and site design for neighborhood projects (Eastland, Cardinal Valley, Lansdowne, Stonewall, Merrick Place, Hamburg, Hartland, Beaumont, Wellesley Heights); shopping center projects (Lexington Green, Hamburg, Beaumont, Tates Creek Center, Lansdowne, Lansbrook, Palomar); parks (Jacobson Park, Lakeside Park and Golf Course, Phoenix Park, Shillito Park); corporate centers and research parks (IBM Recreation Complex, Ashland Oil Headquarters, Coldstream Research Park); stadiums (University of Kentucky Commonwealth Stadium, Lexington Legends baseball field); and the realignment of Main and Vine Streets downtown and the reconstruction of Paris Pike from Lexington to Paris, Ky.  Aten was also involved with both master planning and detailed site design for a variety of Kentucky state parks (Barkley Lake State Park, Blue Heron Campground, Jenny Wiley State Park, Barren River State Park, Pine Mountain State Park, Lake Cumberland State Park, John James Audubon State Park, Buckhorn Lake State Park) and regional state parks (Breaks Interstate Park, Ky. and Va., and Big South Fork National Recreation Area, Ky. and Tenn.).</p><p>While working in private practice, Aten also taught at the University of Kentucky, serving as a Visiting Critic in the Department of Architecture in the College of Engineering (1961-1963) and then as an adjunct Instructor in the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Design in the College of Agriculture (1974-1999). After full retirement from active project management in 2000, Aten served for eight years as a member of the Lexington Fayette County Planning Commission (2000-2008).</p><p>A Certified Landscape Architect through the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB) and a registered landscape architect in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, Aten was a co-founder of the Kentucky chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architecture (ASLA KY) and served as Secretary-Treasurer (1978-1979), Vice President (1979-1980), and President (1980-1981), and Trustee (1985-1986).  He became a member of the national ASLA in 1952 and was named a fellow of the association (FASLA) in 1986.  Aten's civic and community service roles in Lexington, Ky., included President, Citizens Association for Planning; charter member, Metro Environmental Improvement Commission; member, Mayor's Citizen Advisory Commission on Recommendations for the Planning and Zoning Process for Fayette County (1974); and member, Board of Trustees for Cardinal Hill Hospital (1978-1983);</p><p>Throughout his career, Aten received many awards for his landscape architecture work, including a merit award and an outstanding service award from the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA, 1974, 1986); five honor and special recognition awards and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Kentucky Chapter of ASLA (1982-1986, 2016); four honor and merit awards from the Kentucky Society of Architects (1972-1973); three awards from the Metro Environmental Improvement Commission (1970-1974); two awards from the Kentucky Department of Local Government Design (1985); and the Fayette County Outstanding Environmentalist Award (1976).</p><p>A long-distance runner, baseball player, painter, and singer, Aten was a member of and sang in the choir of the Second Presbyterian Church in Lexington, Ky. He was married to Mary Louise Swearington Aten (1929-2007) and Joy Molino Aten (1930- ) and had two daughters, Kathy Aten Birkebak and Susan Aten Borst; a step-son, Dan Molino; and a step-daughter-in-law, Sheila Molino. He died in Lexington, Ky., on July 30, 2017.
