    <head>Biographical Information</head>
<p>Lillian <emph render="doublequote">Lil</emph> Henken Press was born October 18, 1924, in Everett, Massachusetts. She received a Bachelor's degree magna cum laude from Boston University in 1946 and a Master's degree from the then-new Boston U. College of Communications. She and her husband, O. Leonard Press, entered graduate school together in 1947 two weeks after their marriage. While in Boston, Lillian worked as a reporter and writer for a daily newspaper; editor and press representative for American Red Cross; account executive for a public relations agency; and assistant to the press secretary of Massachusetts Governor Maurice Tobin. </p><p>In 1952, Lillian and her husband Leonard moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where she joined the staff of the newly arrived radio station WVLK. She remained there until 1960, rising from copywriter to program director. Several years after the birth of their only child, Lowell, in 1961, Lillian became a volunteer for the newly formed Central Kentucky Mental Health Association. In 1964, at the request of the Association, she directed a survey of mental health resources and needs in nine Central Kentucky counties, as part of a nationwide initiative by President Kennedy. The recommendations offered and publicized in the final report of that survey were significant factors in the later development of Kentucky's statewide mental health system of community mental health centers. To implement the recommendations, Lillian then organized and developed Kentucky's first Regional Mental Health Board which, under her direction, launched Kentucky's first two Comprehensive Care Centers with help from Kentucky's Department of Mental Health, led by Commissioner Dr. Dale Farabee. This became the prototype for a state system of community mental health centers that Dr. Farabee spread across the Commonwealth. In 1967, Lillian was appointed Executive Assistant to Commissioner Farabee. In 1975, she left this role to move into a Senior Associate position with Farabee and Associates, a consultancy firm started by Dr. Farabee after his retirement from the Department of Mental Health. During this time, Lillian started the Sunbelt Institute for Training and Education, first as a division of the firm, then later as an independent for-profit company.  </p><p>In 1980, Lillian moved to Virginia to accept a position as Special Assistant to Al Smith, Federal Co-Chairman of the Appalachian Region Commission appointed by President Jimmy Carter. In late 1982, she was recruited by Governor John Y. Brown to organize and direct Kentucky's Governor's Scholars Program the following year. Lillian returned to Lexington and served as GSP executive director from 1983 to 1992, and the program became a model for other such schools. In 1987, Lillian organized 28 other state Governor's Schools into the National Conference of Governor's Schools (NCoGS) and served as its chair/president until 1992. NCoGS has since established a Distinguished Achievement Award in her name. </p><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Lillian chaired the Kentucky Oral History Commission. During her retirement, she turned her attention to increasing participation of citizens, particularly women, in the political process. In late 2002, she organized The Women's Network, Advocates for Democratic Principles. </p><p>Lillian received an honorary degree from Centre College in 1992 and was a member of the Centre College Board of Trustees for 26 years. In 2006, she received the Martha Layne Collins Leadership Award from Women Leading Kentucky. In 2008, The Women's Network elected her the first recipient of the Lillian Press Distinguished Leadership Award. In 2015, she received an honorary doctorate of humanities from the University of Kentucky.  </p><p>Lillian Press died on April 26, 2020, and is buried at Lexington Cemetery with her husband, Len.  </p><p>
