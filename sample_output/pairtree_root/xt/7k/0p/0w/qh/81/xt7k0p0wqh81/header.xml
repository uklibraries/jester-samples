        <p>The Audio Materials subseries contains the Everett/Edwards Folklore Cassettes, recordings from the Pine Mountain Folklore Project, recorded student folklores, and recordings of William Hugh Jansen from the radio.  The Everett/Edwards folklore cassettes were meant to be a teaching tool and Jansen contributed one lecture for that series.  The Pine Mountain Folklore Project was designed to intensively study the status of folklore in that eastern Kentucky community.  Folklores were collected by initially going door to door in the Pine Mountain Community, and later by going to recommended homes.  The result is a mixture of ballads and spoken folklores.</p>
