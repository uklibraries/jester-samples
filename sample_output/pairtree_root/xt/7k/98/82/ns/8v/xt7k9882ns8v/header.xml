      <p>The European travel diary (dated 1927; 0.04 cubic feet; 1 folder) comprises one diary that documents the travels of a young woman and her friends in Europe in the Summer of 1927. In the diary, the author details their ocean journey to France, describing their neighbors on the ship, inside jokes they made while on board, assistance from staff, and opinions on activities and meals provided to them. Once in Europe, the author details sights visited, hotels stayed in, making friends, driving through the countryside, meals eaten, and little gaffes that occurred throughout their trip. The tour consisted of France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. The diary does not conclude with the end of the trip, it is cut-off halfway through part of the author's stay in Germany.</p><p>The European travel diary collection is part of the Wade Hall Collection of American Letters, which includes correspondence and diaries from all over North America covering the time period of the Civil to Korean Wars. The materials were collected by Wade Hall and document everyday men and women.</p>
