          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Keith Coleman, also known as <title render="doublequote">Dr. Smallhead</title>, was born March 9, 1950 in Wayland, Floyd County, Kentucky. As a youth Coleman was an avid fan of The Beatles. As a young adult he considered punk-rock bands of the 1970s, like The Clash and The Sex Pistols, as the second coming of the British Invasion. In 1979, Coleman moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and began going to punk and new wave shows near University of Kentucky's campus and downtown, at venues like Halle Lou's, Cafe Au Go Go, JDI, ReBop, and Cafe LMNOP. In 1980, he reached out to larger music labels and asked for articles to publish in a music magazine about punk bands. Coleman published the first <title render="italic">Lexington Lost</title> zine in 1980 featuring his beloved Beatles and The Ramones. By the third issue, he began collaborating with Bill Widenor, also known as <title render="doublequote">Uncle Bill</title>, a local punk and illustrator. Other local artists also contributed content to Lexington Lost. The zine began to cover local shows and featured interviews with local punk and new wave bands like The Thrusters, Chinese, Active Ingredients. Many Lexington punks were queer and involved with the local drag community which heavily influenced <title render="italic">Lexington Lost</title>'s aesthetic. Also, every issue had a radical left political column written by Dr. Smallhead. As the zine grew in popularity, Keith Coleman began filming punk shows, with equipment borrowed from Tele Cable. The films were broadcast on Lexington public access television. Overtime, Keith and Bill had differing opinions for the future of <title render="italic">Lexington Lost</title> zine and ended its run with its eleventh issue published on December 14th, 1983. Keith Coleman produced two more punk zines, 1983-1984, called <title render="italic">Dead Species</title>. In 2004, a cd and dvd were released featuring Lexington punk bands recorded during the time <title render="italic">Lexington Lost</title> was published.  Keith Coleman retired from GTE in Lexington and died January 14, 2017. In 2021, General Speech, a locally based international punk distro, published a compendium of <title render="italic">Lexington Lost</title>. </p><p>Sources: </p><p>Keith E.

The collection includes a full run of the original and master copies of the zine's issues.

Bands featured include Talking Heads, The Beatles, The Ramones, as well as local bands like Dementia Precox, Babylon Dance Band, Active Ingredients, Vale of Tears, The Thrusters, Chinese, Red Interiors, and Synthetics.

Finally, the collection contains a DVD and a CD with recordings of early 1980's Lexington music shows and bands.</p>
