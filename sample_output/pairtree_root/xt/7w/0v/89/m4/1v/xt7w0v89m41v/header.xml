          <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Covering an entire city block and situated on Euclid Avenue in the former Adamstown neighborhood, the University of Kentucky Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky, is a multi-purpose arena completed in 1950 for approximately four million dollars. Pre-construction, it was originally named the "Auditorium-Fieldhouse" but was renamed Memorial Coliseum in 1949 before completion to serve as a memorial for the Kentuckians lost to World War II. The dedication ceremony was held on May 20, 1950. (The Coliseum would later honor those lost to the Korean War and subsequent wars.) Championed by President Herman Lee Donovan and designed by architects John T. Gillig and Ernst Johnson, the original design boasted 4,000 to 5,000 seats in the auditorium and 12,000 seats in the basketball pavilion. The final build ended with 11,500 seats, making it the largest arena in the South at the time.</p><p>The Coliseum has undergone two significant renovations. The first in 1990 at a cost of one million dollars, which reduced seating to 8,500 but added a state-of-the-art weight training facility, new basketball and athletics administration offices, players' lounges, and a team meeting room. Enhancements were added later including a new video board and scoreboard in 2007 and new sound system in 2008. The second, full renovation happened in 2023. This added air conditioning for the first time, as well as seating upgrades and a new event space.</p><p>Functionally, Memorial Coliseum is home to University of Kentucky women's basketball, volleyball, gymnastics and STUNT, as well as men's basketball prior to the completion of Rupp Arena in 1976 and swimming and diving before the completion of the Lancaster Aquatics Center in 1989. The building also houses UK's Center for Academic and Tutorial Services (CATS), a 2.4 million dollar facility opened in 1998. Other notable activities that took place in the Coliseum include student registration, graduation, and dances; community events such university presidential inaugurations; and Graduate Record Exams (GRE).</p><p>Sources: </p><p>1. <title render="doublequote">Memorial Coliseum</title> Memorial Coliseum: Home of Kentucky Woman's Basketball, Stunt, Volleyball and Gymnastics;  https://ukathletics.com/facilities/memorial-coliseum/.

        <p>Comprises 36, 55" x 44.5" x .125" panels of names of Kentuckians who died in various wars and military conflicts in the 20th and early 21st centuries that hung in the University of Kentucky Memorial Coliseum, 1950-2023. The names were written in calligraphy (World War II) by engineering professor John Sherman Horine or in calligraphy or lettered in print (Korean War, Vietnam War, and conflicts from 1975-2006). For each war or conflict, names are organized by county and then in alphabetical order within each county. Some of the item numbers are not in consecutive order because of how the panels were received from the construction crews removing the panels.</p>
