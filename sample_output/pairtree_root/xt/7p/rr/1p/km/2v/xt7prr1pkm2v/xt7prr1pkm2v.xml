    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>An enslaved woman and boy were formerly owned by the estate of Samuel Lackey and were placed at auction in 1862 after Lackey's death. They are unnamed and the broadside contains very little information about them. The child was only listed as a 14 year-old, which places his birth year at approximately 1848. The woman was 40 years old, born approximately 1822, and was described as a good cook and washer.  It is unknown whether they were related to each other. Both individuals were to be sold at auction following the death of Samuel Lackey, but it is unknown by whom they were purchased.</p><p>William <emph render="doublequote">Willard</emph> Davis (1837-1885) was born in Madison County, Kentucky, and attended Missouri University and Lexington Law School. Davis served as a tax collector in Kentucky for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue during the Civil War and was appointed as Collector of Internal Revenues in the Second Collection District of Kentucky.  Following the war, he became a lawyer and civil rights advocate. He also became a land speculater and purchased and subdivided the lots which would become Davis Bottom.  Davis moved to Kansas with his family in 1870 and rose to the position of Kansas Attorney General.</p>  </bioghist>
