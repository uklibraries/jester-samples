      <p>Joseph Jefferson Slomer was born in Covington, Kentucky, on August 16, 1897. He started work for Goodman Manufacturing Company, Cinicinnati, Ohio, in 1914 while also studying mechanical drawing, shop, algebra and geometry at the Ohio Mechanics Institute. In November 1918, he began studying radio at the University of Kentucky during World War I as part of the vocational section of the U.S. Army. After the armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, Slomer stayed at the University of Kentucky, enrolling in engineering, and graduated in 1922 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. He moved to Chicago, Illinois, and returned to Goodman Manufacturing Company in 1923, where he worked as an engineer and inventor on mining machinery, hydraulics, and lubrication for over 30 years. He was issued over 30 patents and was an active member of several professional organizations, including as Chairman for the Chicago Section of the American Society of Lubricantion Engineers and Director for the 1951 National Conference on Institutional Hydraulics. He married Lee Mae Christerson on July 22, 1924. They had two children, Joseph Gayle Slomer and Emma Laune Slomer. He died in Chicago in 1965.</p>
