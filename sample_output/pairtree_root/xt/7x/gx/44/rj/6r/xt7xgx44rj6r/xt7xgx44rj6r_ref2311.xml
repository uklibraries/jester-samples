Whisman, who was the first appointed States' Representative. This position grew out of his work with the Eastern Kentucky Regional Planning Commission, a group which was instrumental in the formation of the ARC.</p> <p>The "General" files include calendars, letters, reports on policy, and program development and implementation reflecting areas of interest such as highway construction, health care, water resources, forestry and child development. During the years 1972-1974, these files gradually portray a shift in Whisman's activities towards increased participation in conferences as an expert in regional development and travel to meetings. Also included are 1974 newspaper articles critical of Whisman followed by his responses to the Appalachian Governors, and the 1975 legislation passed that changed the authority of the States' Representative position.</p> <p>The "Travel" files contain materials such as travel vouchers, itineraries, and receipts and/or copies of receipts.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref2312" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2314" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2322" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2434" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref2643" level="subseries"/> </c>
