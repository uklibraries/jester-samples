These requests were submitted approximately 24 months prior to the FY start. For example FY 1969 was submitted in the fall of 1967 for a FY beginning date of October 1, 1969.</p> <p>From 1967-forward budget requests were also submitted by the Appalachian Governors to the Senate and House Congressional Appropriations Committees 18-20 months prior to the beginning of the FY. For example, the FY 1969 request was sent to Congress in January-February of 1968 for a FY beginning date of October 1, 1969.</p> <p>From 1967-1980 bound books of the Budget of the United States Appendix are available. These contain the President's recommendations to Congress on line items. After 1980, the President no longer included the ARC in his budget; final appropriations for the ARC came through Congressional authorization. However, beginning again in 1990, the ARC was included in the President's budget.</p> <p>Following the budget documents are the reports for funds expended and carryover monies for each fiscal year. These are arranged chronologically, from 1966-current.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1192" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1224" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1239" level="subseries"/> </c>
