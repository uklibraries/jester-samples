          <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Passed by Congress in 1965, the Appalachian Regional Development Act established the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) to plan and manage economic development in the region. The Act defines the region as the entire state of West Virginia and parts of twelve other states--Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.</p><p>ARC concentrates its efforts in two major areas. The highway program, which annually receives about two-thirds of the ARC's funds, provides for construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The other major program, area development, provides grants for education and health care, water and sewer systems, housing, child development, enterprise development, natural resources development, and research on topics related to the region's economic development. Grants to undertake these projects are often combined with local and/or state funds.</p><p>The ARC is organized to ensure federal, state, and local participation. The Commission consists of fourteen members--the thirteen Appalachian governors and a Federal Co-Chair, appointed by the President. An executive director heads the Commission staff.</p><p>Staff members are paid jointly by the federal government and the states. Both Commission members and staff, through its member states, work with the Local Development Districts (LDDs), the multi-county planning and development agencies covering all 397 Appalachian counties.</p><p>The process of designing and funding ARC programs and projects is also structured to include all levels of government involvement. The ARC receives an annual appropriation from Congress and these funds are allocated by formula to the thirteen states. The governor of each state is responsible for developing an annual plan for meeting the ARC objectives, with input from the LDDs. The plan identifies specific projects that will receive ARC funds, usually in combination with other, federal, state, or local funds. Each state's development and project plan must be approved by the Commission.</p>

      <p>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) records (dated 1958-2018, undated; 329.46 cubic feet; 961 boxes) consist of the official records of the Appalachian Regional Commission since its inception in 1965 as well as reports of the projects funded by the ARC across the 13 states that make up the Appalachian Region. </p><p>The records are divided into eight series: Internal documents, State plans, Final project reports, Local development Districts, Appalachian Development Highway System assorted papers and documents, Audiovisual, 2020ms106 addition, and 2023ms095 addition. The Internal Documents reflect the ARC's daily operations and range from annual reports and official Commission meeting materials to files of background information on regional development and policy papers. The State Plans, submitted annually to the ARC, are each state's program development documentation and investment plans for its Appalachian counties. The Final Project Reports are those submitted by demonstration projects and programs funded, in whole or in part, by the ARC. And the Local Development Districts document the relationship between the ARC and the LDDs and the specific activities of the LDDs. Materials range from profiles of individual LDDs to reports on projects executed by the LDDs, which were funded by sources other than the ARC. In addition, the records contain audio-visual materials, oral history interviews conducted by Duke University, and a small photograph collection. The 2020ms106 addition contains internal documents, research and travel materials, and newspaper clippings primarily from the tenure of Earl F. Gohl as Federal Co-Chair.The 2023ms095 additon contains photographs and publications not found in the orignal accession from the tenure of Winifred A. Pizzano as Federal Co-Chair in the 1980s.</p>

        <p>This section comprises approximately one-third of the ARC Archives and primarily reflects the daily operations of the ARC, as executed both by the staff and by the official Commission members. These documents are extensive in their scope, although not chronologically complete in every category. Topics covered include Commission meetings, policy, research reports, fiscal history, and the history of the Appalachian Regional Development Act. In addition, two headings describe the origins of the ARC: "Pre-ARC History" includes the documents of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission (PARC); and "Start-Up" contains the 1965 documents which were the blue-prints for ARC operations--from office procedures to policy-making.</p>

        <p>Each fiscal year states submitted documents to the ARC outlining a plan of fiscal management and program development for its Appalachian counties. This section is arranged alphabetically by state and further subdivided chronologically. The materials for each state and year vary considerably; they range from correspondence to drafts of the comprehensive state plan, and from specific program plans (e.g. health, economic, child development) to plans submitted for only the Appalachian portion of a state. Each state is not chronologically complete. Note that abstracts and summaries of State Plans are located in Boxes 355-356.</p>

        <p>ike "Internal Documents", this section comprises approximately one-third of the ARC Archives.  It is divided into three categories:  project reports that are site-specific and, therefore, arranged by state; those that are regional in scope; and finally, "Program Analyses", reports in which the main purpose was evaluation.</p>
        <p>Project reports were placed in this section if, somewhere on the document, funding credit is given to the ARC or if an ARC contract number appears on the item.  Other project reports are located in the last section, Local Development Districts--Publications and Reports (See Boxes 660-771).</p>
        <p>Each entry is arranged:</p>
        <p>            Title/ author; date. Project number (if available)</p>
        <p>Often the reports have only contract numbers (e.g. 66-100) which were simply accession numbers for the ARC.  These numbers are not included in an entry.  Project numbers usually, but not always, take the form:  KY-0000-00-I-201-0000.  The first two letters indicate the general source of money from which the funding came-- in this example, the money originated from funds allocated to Kentucky projects; the number, 201, represents the program category, "Highways".  Since this entire inventory can be keyword searched, it is possible for a researcher to see all project reports that fall into a particular program category, if that report has a project number.</p>
        <p>All reports which are marked "OVERSIZE" refer to the Box and Folder number where that item is located.</p>

        <p>Arranged by topics, these materials date primarily from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. Originally collected by former ARC staff member, Paige Ingraham, these are documents mainly generated by the ARC and sent to the LDD's as guidelines. The LDD's documentation of compliance is outlined in the section, "LDD Profiles (1973)", Boxes 635-652.</p>
        <p>The files also contain information about LDD practices in non-Appalachian states including Governor's executive orders, regional planning documents and establishment legislation. Also included are "Establishment Documents" for ARC-LDD's, grouped by state. These contain legislation and executive orders on the state and local level which provided guidelines for LDD organization and bylaws for ARC-LDD's.</p>

        <p>Development of an adequate transportation system is the Commission's first priority in improving the Region's economy. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) was designed to open up isolated areas so that economic development could occur. The ADHS connects at strategic points to interstate highways and is laid out so that most of the Region's population is no more than thirty minutes away from either an interstate or an Appalachian highway.  At the end of FY 2010, of the 3,090 miles authorized to be improved, 2,715.1 were completed or under construction.</p>
        <p>Periodic studies of the cost to complete the highway system were developed to be a basis for allocation of authorized and appropriated funds among the states.</p>
