She graduated with a degree in English in 1974 from Elon University, where she also played basketball.  She earned a master's degree in counseling from Liberty University in 1987.  Yow was hired by Sue Feamster as head coach of the University of Kentucky Lady Kats women's basketball team in 1976.  Yow was at UK until 1980, then coached women's basketball at Oral Roberts University (1981-1983) and the University of Florida (1983-1985).  <emph render="doublequote">She took these three previously unranked teams into the top 20 national rankings</emph> (<title render="doublequote">Debbie Yow,</title> Wikipedia, accessed 3/2/2023).  In 1985, Yow accepted a promotion and began her second career as an athletics administrator at the University of Florida and went on to the University of North Carolina-Greensboro as associate athletic director.  From 1990 to 2019, Yow served as Athletic Director at Saint Louis University (1990-1994), University of Maryland (1994-2010, the first woman athletic director in any Atlantic Coast Conference school), and North Carolina State University (2010-2019).  Yow received the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics James J. Corbett Memorial Award in 2019 and was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.  Yow was married to Lynn Nance, 1980, and is currently married to William Bowden, 1983- .  Yow's two sisters Kay Yow (1942-2009) and Susan Yow (1954- ) were/are also basketball players and coaches.
