    <bioghist>
      
            <p>Rogers C. B. Morton was born on September 19, 1914. A descendant of the Revolutionary War hero George Rogers Clark, whom he was named for, Morton came from a wealthy and prominent Louisville, Kentucky family. His older brother, Thruston B. Morton, had served in Washington, D.C. as Senator from Kentucky (1957-1969), as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (1959-1961), and as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations under President Eisenhower (1953-1956). It was as campaign manager for his brother that the younger Morton gained his first experience in the political arena. </p>
            <p>In 1952 Morton moved his immediate family from Kentucky to Maryland's Eastern Shore country. On his Easton, Maryland farm he established a cattle finishing operation. He stepped back into politics in 1960, when he managed the unsuccessful congressional campaign of Edward T. Miller, the Republican nominee for Maryland's First District congressional seat. In 1962 Morton himself ran for the First District seat in the House of Representatives and won. Maryland's First District was heavily registered in favor of the Democratic party, yet Morton (a Republican) won re-election to Congress for five consecutive terms. </p>
            <p>Morton brought a successful background in business to his congressional office. In addition to his private business operations in Maryland, he had served as president of the family company, Ballard and Ballard, until it was sold to the Pillsbury Company in 1951. After the merger, he remained as vice-president of Pillsbury until 1953 and as director and a member of the executive committee until he resigned the post in January, 1971.</p>
            <p>Morton's Congressional files reflect his firm belief in the committee system of legislation. From 1963 to 1968 he served on the House Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs and Merchant Marines and Fisheries. During the 90th Congress (1967-1968) the Select Committee on Small Business was added to his two previous committee assignments. </p>
            <p>While serving on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Morton made trips to the Trust Territories of the Pacific. His position at the ranking minority member on the Subcommittee on Territorial and Insular Affairs won him appointment to the United States-Puerto Rico Commission on the status of Puerto Rico in 1965. He also used his position on the Interior Committee as a valuable step in passing important environmental legislation for the Eastern Shore and Chesapeake Bay area.</p>
            <p>With the beginning of the 91st Congress (1969-1970) Morton gave up his previous committee assignments in order to take a seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. </p>
            <p>Morton was throughout his career an active partisan for the Republican Party. Following the Republican defeat in the Presidential election of 1964, he began work to help rebuild the party's fortunes. Morton consistently supported Richard M. Nixon as the party's Presidential candidate for 1968. At the 1968 Republican National Convention he served as Nixon's floor manager, helping Nixon to achieve a first round nomination. This close working relationship carried over into the new President's administration, and when Republican National Committee Chairman Ray Bliss submitted his resignation, Nixon chose Morton as Bliss' replacement. Morton accepted the position, but continued to hold his congressional seat as well. He refused to accept the substantial salary which accompanied the chairmanship. Morton held the position as Republican National Committee Chairman from 1969 until 1971. </p>
            <p>Following Nixon's election in 1968 there was some anticipation that Morton would be named to the new President's cabinet. The post of Secretary of the Interior was one in which Morton had expressed interest. Fulfilling a campaign promise, Nixon was obliged to appoint his Secretary of the Interior from one of the western states. Accordingly, he nominated Governor Walter J. Hickel of Alaska. Hickel was sworn in as Secretary in January 1969, after lengthy nomination hearings. </p>
            <p>However, Hickel's tenure as Secretary was a short one. In mid-1970, Hickel publicly opposed President Nixon's policy on the bombing of Cambodia and the administration's stance on the youth protest movement. As a result Hickel was asked to resign his post in November of 1970 and Morton was named to take his place. </p>
            <p>Morton was officially nominated and confirmed as Secretary of the Interior in January, 1971. He was the first easterner to hold the position of Secretary of the Interior. His tenure in the post began with the immediate controversy surrounding the approval of a building permit for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. It was an issue which reoccurred through Morton's first four years in office. </p>
            <p>The varied responsibilities of the Department of the Interior are reflected in the issues which arose during Morton's term as Secretary. The Native American movement gained momentum - In November of 1972 a Native American group took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs Building in Washington, D. C., and in March of 1973 the Wounded Knee Incident made national headlines. </p>
            <p>Coal mine safety and health regulations became a primary concern for the Bureau of Mines. Development of alternative energy sources due to the depletion of natural resources and the Arab oil embargo became so important that in 1975 Morton was appointed to head the President's Energy Resources Council. </p>
            <p>From February to April of 1973 Morton underwent radiation treatment for prostate cancer at Stanford University in California. He established a small office at Menlo Park, California, and was kept informed and remained active in government affairs while undergoing treatment. </p>
            <p>The scandals involving Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and Watergate rocked the Nixon administration during 1973 and 1974. Morton's position as Secretary of the Interior survived the resignation of Richard Nixon and he continued in the post under President Gerald R. Ford. </p>
            <p>In April of 1975 Morton moved from the Department of the Interior to the Commerce Department. Speculation was that he could do more for the President's re-election hopes if he were in a position that would allow him to reach the business community. There were also reports that Morton's declining health might be at least partially responsible for the move. In any case, Morton's stay at the Commerce Department lasted less than a year. Though short, his time there was not uneventful. He was threatened with a contempt citation because he refused to reveal documents subpoenaed by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations which were connected to American businesses and the Arab oil boycott. A compromise was eventually achieved between Morton and the Committee. </p>
            <p>During the Presidential election in 1976, the Republican party was faced with the battle of recouping the losses caused by Watergate. Morton left the Cabinet to direct the President Ford Election Committee in 1976, and served in that position until after the Republican National Convention. </p>
            <p>Morton retired from public life in 1977. He returned to Pres'quile, his home on the Eastern Shore, to raise cattle and run the custom-made boat business he has established while serving as Secretary of Commerce. Morton died at his home on April 19, 1979. </p>
            <p>Rogers C. B. Morton was educated in the public schools of Jefferson County, Kentucky, and at Woodberry Forrest, a preparatory school in Virginia. He was a 1937 Graduate of Yale and attended medical school at Columbia University for one year before deciding to return to the family business in Kentucky. He served for a brief period in the Navy and later enlisted as a private in the Army following the United States' entry into World War Two. He saw action in the European Theater and left the Army in 1945 as a Captain of Field Artillery. Morton was married to the former Anne Prather Jones of Louisville, Kentucky, and they had two children - a son, David, and a daughter, Anne. </p>

              <p>The Congressional Series reflects Morton's firm belief in the committee process of lawmaking. Morton's voting record during his tenure as U.S. Representative of Maryland's First Congressional District has been placed in front of the series to provide an overview of his record in Congress. In general, the series is arranged in chronological order. Bills are divided by Congressional session and listed according to the date they were introduced in the House. The Legislative subseries is arranged chronologically and alphabetically by committee name within each year. The remainder of the subseries are arranged primarily chronologically and then alphabetically by folder title. </p>

              <p>Morton served as Secretary of the Interior under both President Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford. The boxes in this series are divided into four subseries. Except for the Subject Files subseries, the arrangement is basically chronological with folders arranged alphabetically within the years. The Subject Files integrate several groups as shipped from Washington, D.C. The largest group was labeled "Subject and Individuals" and was boxed alphabetically. "Menlo Park" indicates that the file was in a group generated during Morton's cancer treatment in Menlo Park, California, February 19 - April 13, 1973. "1971 Alphabetical File" indicates that the material was from a box so-labeled. Two other miscellaneous subject boxes were also included but are not indicated due to lack of coherence. Bulky files were split into #1, #2, etc. there is generally no rationale behind the division except to divide the material as it stood in the original files and make it more physically manageable. Folders are also numbered if there were multiple folders with the same title but no distinction as to sub-category. Several files labeled "Republican National Committee" were originally, obviously erroneously, included in the material. "Personal File" indicates that the material had been kept at Morton's Easton, Maryland home. Names are simply transferred from the original folder label. In the case of inconsistency, the more formal name was used.</p>

              <p>The Counselor to the President Series consists of four boxes which cover the months from February to November, 1976. It contains correspondence, brochures, press releases, lists, clippings, speeches, and reports. One of Morton's main responsibilities was to solicit executive branch support for the Ford campaign as well as act as a White House liaison to the election committee. There are some letters in the files on the Ford campaign dated before Morton officially moved from the White House to the election committee, as well as many letters addressed to Howard (Bo) Callaway and Jim Baker, the campaign managers. The files are arranged alphabetically and in reverse chronological order within the folders. </p>

              <p>The Publications Series is divided into six subseries based on type and content of the publications. Each of the subseries is placed in chronological order, except for the Books Subseries where the arrangement is dictated by size and shape. Some of the items in the Publications Series were sent to Morton by friends and constituents and are of a personal nature. Some of the material is directly related to the stages of Morton's career. Whenever an item was signed by the author, editor, or presenter, that circumstance has been noted in the inventory. </p>
