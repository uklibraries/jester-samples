    <scopecontent>  <p>This collection contains the papers and photographs of George H. Goodman and Edwin J. Paxton, consecutive owners of the <title>Paducah News-Democrat</title>. Most of the materials pertain to George Goodman and concern the activities of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in Kentucky during his tenure as director. Also included are semi-monthly and annual WPA reports and Goodman's business correspondence from 1922 to 1941.  There is significant correspondence, clippings, testimony and affidavits concerning charges made by Governor A.B. Chandler that the Kentucky WPA pressured its employees to support Alben Barkley in the 1938 Democratic Senatorial primary. The rest of the collection consists of financial statements for the <title>News-Democrat</title> dating from the 1920's and a small segment of Edwin Paxton's correspondence.</p> <p>The photographs from this collection, removed to Audio-Visual Archives (PA64M1), document WPA projects in the state, among them the Audubon museum near Henderson and the restoration of the McDowell House near Danville. Although views of buildings and construction activities predominate, some of the photographs show WPA employees at work. </p></scopecontent>
