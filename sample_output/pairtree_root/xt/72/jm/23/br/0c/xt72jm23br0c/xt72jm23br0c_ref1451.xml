A majority of the papers in the series came from Senator Chandler's Versailles office. Unfortunately the material generated from his Washington office is incomplete. The Senatorial Series consists of seven files which are arranged according to significance. Within each file, the papers are arranged chronologically and/or alphabetically. The files are: Important Papers File, Political File, Correspondence, Washington-Versailles Office Correspondence, General Correspondence, Miscellaneous File, Invitation File, Walter W. Mulbry Personal Correspondence.</p> <p>Chandler, who resigned as governor in 1939 to accept an appointment to the U.S. Senate replacing the late M.M. Logan, was elected in a 1940 special election to the seat to complete Logan's term and was re-elected for a full term in 1942. The Senator was a member of the Military Affairs Committee and was chairman of a sub-committee which visited Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in 1942. In 1943 Chandler made a global tour of U.S. military installations as a member of a Senate inspection team. He also served on the Mines and Mining, Privileges and Elections, Interoceanic Canals, and Judiciary Committees.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1452" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1456" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1469" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1498" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1505" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1657" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1688" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1696" level="subseries"/> </c>
