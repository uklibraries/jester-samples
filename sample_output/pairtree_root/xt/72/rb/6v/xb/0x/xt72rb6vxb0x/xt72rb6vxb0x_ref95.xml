These young men are citizens of Mexico and had never before attended English-speaking school. They are fine fellows, and you can see by their expressions that they are not bolshevists in any sense of the word. They have pride, self-respect, and are industrious. Also very anxious to improve themselves. I rejoice that their school continues for several months. Nicholos is in advanced class.
