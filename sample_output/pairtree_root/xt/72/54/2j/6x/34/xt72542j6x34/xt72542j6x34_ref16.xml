The date is not clear, nor is it certain that the letter was written by Altrusa member Ellen Connor. Notes are written on the back of the letter in what appears to be different handwriting; perhaps at a later date.</p> <p>The "draft notes" were typed on a sheet of paper with the header for the Mildren Burress Insurance Agency, however there lacks a name or proper title. It is suspected that the written passages were meant for a speech to be presented to Altrusa members. The contents discusses problems facing women's equality and social independence.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
