          <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Altrusa International, Inc. is an international organization of professional women who work to create community-wide enrichment through volunteer service. Professionals are drawn from a wide range of backgrounds and careers. Historically, membership was by invitation, and individual clubs monitored applicants to ensure that only one representative from any specific business field or profession was selected for invitation. While members must be classified according to a particular field or career, the organization itself is non-partisan and non-sectarian. </p><p>At the local level clubs concentrate on programs to benefit their communities as well as participate in international projects supported by Altrusa International, such as the Grants-in-Aid fund and the Founder's Fund. While the creation of local committees might show variation, the main organizational structure has not changed since the emergence of Altrusa in 1917.  Local clubs, headed by a Board of Directors, are grouped into Districts, each of which is under the supervision of a Governor and her corresponding Board of Directors. Above the District level is the International level, which is headed by the President of Altrusa International and her Board.</p><p>The Altrusa Club of Lexington was founded on November 15, 1923; the organization did not become International until 1935. Jessie O. Yancey, formerly of the Louisville Club (1917), was its first president. Membership regularly included members connected to the University of Kentucky, including former UK Special Collections head, Jacqueline Bull. As Altrusa International grew in membership, district lines changed, with the Lexington Club shifting from the third, to the fifth, and finally the sixth district, which, as of current, includes Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. Several members of the Lexington Club have gone on to serve at the District and International level. The Club, still active, now refers to themselves as Altrusa International of Lexington.</p>

        <p>Administration contains papers and correspondence regarding the administration of club activities as a whole. Series have been constructed to reflect the administrative board of the club, namely, the Board of Directors, also known as the Executive Board. Subdivided by International, District and Local, referring to the corresponding administrative levels of the of the Altrusa International organization, distinct differences being that District Boards are headed by a "Governor," who oversees activities of all those local clubs within district lines. General papers lacking better classification under alternative series have also been placed here under "General." For papers and correspondence as originating from a specific committee, see the Committee series.</p>
        <p>Given the organization's specific requirements as to membership into the club, papers relating to club membership and classification are quite numerous. See both the Membership Committee and the Membership series under the Local Administration branch. The Club Manuals also provide explicit information regarding the organization of Altrusa, the creation of a local club, and the induction and responsibilities of members.</p>

See the Member's Manual for a description of specific rules as to when and where a convention or conference in a given year might be held. The listing of multiple districts reflects the changing of district lines over the years.</p>

        <p>Contains papers and correspondence from Altrusa committees. Some committees are essential, and required by Altrusa International, while others were created ad hoc or as a result of a local club project. See the Member's Manual for a list and description of committee practices and policies. Some of the Yearbooks, or the Directories, contain information regarding committee activity; these resource will also list membership of a committee for a given year.</p>
        <p>It is also likely that checking the club minutes will provide a clearer overview of a committees' activities for a year. Each committee is required to submit a yearly report and often these are included with the minutes. Club minutes are typically detailed, and while not completely contiguous, run a date range from the Club's inception in 1923 to July 1989.</p>

        <p>The Printed Materials Series contains published material meant for use by members either for local or international news and information.  A number of news bulletins and serials have been collected. Districts put out both a "service bulletin" and a "newsletter." The collection includes items that chart the progression of the Lexington Club from the Third to Fifth to Sixth Districts. The International Board follows similar practice, putting out a service bulletin as well as a monthly magazine, the <emph render="italic">International Altrusan</emph>; the collection contains an almost complete run from June 1953 to June 1976.</p>
