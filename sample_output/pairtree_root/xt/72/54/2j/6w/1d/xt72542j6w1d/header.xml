          <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The first organization of postal employees in Louisville was formed on November 9, 1895. It was associated with the National Association of Post Office Clerks as Branch No. 80. The main purpose of the organization was to influence legislation pending before Congress. After the first push, interest seemed to wane and disagreements developed within the union. The last recorded meeting was August 22, 1898.</p><p>The present Louisville postal clerks' organization was formed just before the organization of the National Federation of Post Office Clerks in Chicago, August 27, 1906. The Louisville group was one of six locals represented and was designated Branch No. 4. The local regarded the founding date of the National Federation as its own anniversary. </p><p>The major difference between the postal clerks' union and other unions is that the men are employed by the federal government instead of by private business. Because of this, Article II, Section 3, of the National Federation Constitution says, <emph render="doublequote">.... Legislation and not strike is the last resort in the adjustment of our grievance â€¦</emph>. This also means that much of the energy of the union is directed toward influencing postal legislation. Other than this, union activities are the same as in any other union. </p><p>A Sick Benefit Branch was organized as early as 1913, to provide as much as $250.00 relief for any ill member. Women were always admitted to membership, but the relation of the union to black clerks was a continuing problem. </p><p>In 1971 five unions, the United Federation of Postal Clerks, the National Postal Union, the National Association of Post Office and General Service Maintenance Employees, the National Federation of Post Office Motor Vehicle Employees, and the National Association of Special Delivery Messengers combined into the American Postal Workers Union. </p><p>The American Postal Workers, Local No. 4, Louisville, is still active with 624 members in 2020.</p><p>Resources: </p><p><title render="doublequote">American Postal Workers, Local No. 4, Louisville</title>, <title render="italic">Union Facts</title>, https://www.unionfacts.com/lu/71576/APWU/4/, accessed 2020 November 30.</p><p><title render="doublequote">American Postal Workers Union</title>, <title render="italic">Wikipedia</title>, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Postal_Workers_Union#, accessed 2020 November 30.</p><p><title render="doublequote">APWU History</title>, APWU, https://www.apwu.org/apwu-history, accessed 2020 November 30.</p>

      <p>The National Federation of Post-Office Clerks, Local No. 4 records (dated 1895-1960, undated; 6 boxes, 2.5 cubic feet) comprises documents created by Louisville's local post office union, as well as, the Allied Council of Federal Employees in Louisville, the Central Kentucky District of the Kentucky Federation of Post Office Clerks, the Kentucky Federation of Post Office Clerks, The National Federation of Post Office Clerks, and the National Association of Letter Carriers. The documents include minutes, financial statements, reports, and correspondence of the Allied Council of Federal Employees in Louisville, to which the postal local belonged from 1942 to 1952. The collection also contains minutes and the constitution and bylaws of the local, as well as materials on the 1954, 1956, and 1958 conventions of the Kentucky Federation of Post Office Clerks. Seniority lists of the Louisville Post Office are present, along with miscellaneous materials such as clippings, union publications, and reports from national conventions. There are also records of the Allied Council of Federal Employees which is composed of representatives from postal and railway unions. Of significance is the correspondence between union members and their elected representatives in Washington, D.C.</p>
