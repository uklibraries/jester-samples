    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Samuel Oldham was a freedman in Lexington, Kentucky. He was the father of at least one child, a daughter Fanny, who was married to Willis Battleton. In 1857, Oldham and Battleton contracted with Fanny's master to buy her freedom. Oldham was a barber and a respected member of the community. He was guardian to Mary Clark, a freedwoman, and was responsible for training his apprentice, Henry Mitchell. He managed his own property and that of Lucy Price and Reuben Burnley. He served as the executor of Richard Morrison's estate. A letter of introduction, written for him by Mayor O.F. Payne of Lexington, testifies to the respect accorded him within the community.</p>  </bioghist>
