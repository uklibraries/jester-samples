      <p>John James Floyd [1750-1783] came to Kentucky in 1774 as a surveyor; he helped lay out the new town of Louisville. During the American Revolution he was a privateer. Captured by the British in the West Indies, he escaped to France and, through the help of American Minister Benamin Franklin, made his way back to Kentucky. He was a colonel in the Kentucky Militia, served with George Rogers Clark, and was one of the first two judges of the Kentucky Territory.</p>
