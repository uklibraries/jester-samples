      <p>John Scott Lansill, a native of New York, was a federal government official and a civic leader in Lexington, Kentucky. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1916 and was a veteran of both World Wars. Lansill held several government positions, including Director of the United States Resettlement Administration's Division of Suburban Resettlement, a New Deal agency. The Resettlement Administration was established by executive order in 1935 and was absorbed into the Department of Agriculture as the Farm Security Administration in 1937. In Lexington, Kentucky, Lansill was one of the founders of the Idle Hour Country Club, the curator of Transylvania University, and a member of the Kentucky Historical Society.</p>

      <p>The John Scott Lansill papers (dated 1926-1940, undated; 15 cubic feet; 24 boxes, 3 items) consist of records, correspondence, reports, maps, and photographs relating to the United States Resettlement Administration Division of Suburban Resettlement, a New Deal agency directed by John Scott Lansill. The majority of the collection relates to the Greenbelt Town Program. This project relocated destitute or low income families into newly constructed, planned communities. It also provided construction work for some of the jobless. The papers include official correspondence, reports, photographs, drawings, and publicity papers relating to the Greenbelt program, particularly to four model Greenbelt towns: Greenbelt, Maryland; Greenbrook, New Jersey; Greendale, Wisconsin; and Greenhills, Ohio. These materials, especially the photographs, reveal the state of housing before governmental intervention in these areas.</p><p>Some of the materials cover projects of the Resettlement Administration after its functions were absorbed by other departments. Similarly, the collection has a bound map of the land program under the Federal Emergency Relief Administration which had been incorporated into the Resettlement Administration. There are other miscellaneous materials about general town planning.</p><p>The photographs series has been digitized. Duplicate photographs were digitized only when the content (front or back) varies from the original).</p>
