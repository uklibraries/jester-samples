    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The John Louis Martin sketchbook (dated 1908-1918, 1989, undated; 0.03 cubic feet; 2 folders) comprises a single sketchbook belonging to John Louis Martin, a stagehand and set designer at the Buckingham Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky during the first part of the twentieth century. The sketchbook features vibrant sketches and paintings of various stage designs, architectural designs, nature sketches, landscape paintings and sketches of steamboats. The sketches are either in color or simple pencil. The stage designs, landscapes and steamboat sketches are very detailed and intricate for their small size. One of the sketches is of a rough head steamboat on the Cincinnati River near Louisville. Also featured are multiple sketches of downtown Louisville and the outside of The Buckingham Theatre. Also included in this collection are two newspaper clippings from the Louisville Courier-Journal about the history of The Buckingham Theatre, renamed The Savoy Theatre in 1894, and the permanent closing of the theater in 1989.</p><p>The John Louis Martin sketchbook collection is part of the Wade Hall Collection of American letters, which includes correspondence and diaries from all over North America covering the time period of the Civil to Korean Wars. The materials were collected by Wade Hall and document everyday men and women.</p>  </scopecontent>
