The surveys document information on service history, personal background, cause of death, and any other details the person may have acquired. This first subseries, the World War II biographies, are the most extensive in this series. It includes the survey and articles on Franklin Rungon Sousley, one of the six men in the famous photograph of troops raising the flag on Iwo Jima. The first series concludes with surveys on servicemen not from Kentucky, civilians, marines, and the Royal Canadian Air Force. The second subseries is World War II Surveys of former University of Kentucky Students, beginning with World War I casualty Robert Kinne whose papers were donated by Professor and Mrs. Brinkley Barnett. The other subseries are the Korean War Survey, which is in the same format as the World War II survey, and the Counties, which is organized by Kentucky county instead of last names. Many surveys also include newspaper articles and photographs of soldiers.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref2" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref204" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref244" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref282" level="subseries"/> </c>
