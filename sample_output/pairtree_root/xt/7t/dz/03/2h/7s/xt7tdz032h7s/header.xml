          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Mary Moore Molony was born in 1912 to Elizabeth Samuel and John Durham Nash in Versailles, Kentucky. She was a graduate of the University of Kentucky where she earned a BA in 1932 and an MA in 1934. In 1940 she married Charles Molony, former head of the Lexington bureau of the Associated Press. During the Second World War, Molony served as assistant to the chairman of the National Planning Association in Washington, D.C.  During 1951-1952, she attended Harvard University with her husband who was there as a Nieman fellow. While at Harvard, she won a Bread Loaf fellowship for short stories written in a writing course at Harvard. She was awarded the fellowship by recommendation from novelist A.B. <title render="doublequote">Bud</title> Guthrie. Her attendance at the Bread Loaf Writers Conference, hosted by Middlebury College, Vermont, developed into a long association and friendship with conference staff. Mary Moore Moloney served as conference secretary from 1952 to 1968. She was the editor of <title render="italic">The American Scholar</title>, a publication of the Phi Beta Kappa, from 1958 to 1972. Mary Moore Molony died at her second home in Sarasota, Florida during March of 1980.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Mary Moore Molony papers (dated 1928-1980; 2.08 cubic feet; 6 boxes) primarily comprise manuscripts, letters, poems written by friends and others, notebooks, photographs, and various print materials created or collected by Mary Moore Molony during the 1920s through to the 1980s. The manuscripts include both finished manuscripts that were mailed off to be considered for publication by magazines and literary agents as well as  unfinished, untitled manuscripts. The letters are between Mary Moore Molony and her friends, family, other writers, and editors. Items of note include the typescript of John D. Nash's civil war era 21st Kentucky Infantry diary, and letters from A. B. <title render="doublequote">Bud</title> Guthrie giving criticism and feedback on Molony's writings as well as general talk about his life and career.</p><p>Mary Moore Molony's papers reflect both her writing activities and her friendships with famous poets, writers, critics, editors, and literary agents including Robert Frost, John Ciardi, Theodore Morrison, Julia Child, Avis DeVoto, Bud Guthrie, and Barbara Rex. The letters to Molony yield important insights into the careers of several of her correspondents--particularly those of A.B. <title render="doublequote">Bud</title> Guthrie. In his letters Guthrie provides details of his contractual arrangements with both publishers and motion picture companies at a time when his career was at its apex. The Bread Loaf Conference materials also include valuable information on the operation of the annual conference. Several of the photographs that accompany the material are of great interest because they depict some of the most notable writers and poets of the twentieth century. Finally, Molony's writings and correspondence with her agent provide a picture of how difficult it is for a writer to get published. </p>
