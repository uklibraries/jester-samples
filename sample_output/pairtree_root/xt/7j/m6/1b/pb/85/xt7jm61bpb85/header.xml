      <p>The author of this handwritten manuscript is unknown. Though the author is unknown, a few things about them may be discerned from the contents of the manuscript. The author was well educated, understood Latin, and had access to historical writings, namely those of historian Edward Gibbon. The author was particularly interested in early Imperial Roman history, a period in which Greco-Roman, Christian, and Jewish cultures interacted, which is reflected in the notebook.</p>
