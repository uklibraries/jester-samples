          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>A branch of North American Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry was founded in 1784 by its namesake after he and a group of fourteen other African-Americans were refused admittance into the St. John Lodge in Boston, Massachusetts. After this rejection Prince Hall and his group applied to the Grand Lodge of England and were granted a charter for African Lodge No. 459, which would go on to become the stepping block from which all of Prince Hall Freemasonry would eventually develop. More lodges were organized during the remainder of Prince Hall's life, and after his death a Grand Lodge was formed in his name. This Grand Lodge would later be denied acknowledgment by the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts and subsequently declare itself independent in 1827. Persisting as a predominantly African-American fraternity, Prince Hall Freemasonry stood as an opportunity for African-Americans to join a lodge despite widespread racial segregation in the country. Walter T. Bradley Jr. was a member of the Lodge, attaining a rank of 33rd degree mason and holding the position of Grand Secretary of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge F. &amp; A. M. of Kentucky. He took his duties seriously and devoted much of his professional and personal life to the betterment of the Lodge and its members. </p><p>https://nkaa.uky.edu/nkaa/items/show/1071
