          <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Spindletop Hall, located on the eight-hundred-acre Spindletop Farm, was constructed by Mildred (Pansy) Yount in 1935. Yount and her husband, Miles Frank Yount, gained new wealth after discovering oil in a dormant, Beaumont, Texas, oil field named Spindletop Field. In 1933, eight years after the oil discovery, Miles Yount suffered a sudden heart attack and died.  </p><p>After the death of her husband, Pansy Yount decided to relocate to Kentucky, purchased Spindletop Farm, and began the construction of Spindletop Hall. At its completion, Spindletop Hall was an impressive mansion with classical architecture and modern amenities. It comprised 40 rooms, each with its own thermostat, 14 bathrooms, 11 fireplaces, and covered over 45,000 square feet. Notably, the circular staircase and 1,800 square foot living room were the largest in Kentucky at construction.  </p><p>Yount moved out of Spindletop in 1955 and sold the farm to the University of Kentucky in 1959 for $850,000. In 1962, the same year as Yount's death, the University of Kentucky Faculty, Staff, and Alumni Club moved into Spindletop Hall.  In September 2012, the hall and surrounding buildings entered the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. </p><p>References
