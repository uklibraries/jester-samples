      <p>The Charles E. Lowther <title render="doublequote">Coal Miner's Diary, Summer 1978</title> photocopy (dated 1978; 0.02 cubic feet; 1 folder) consists of a photocopy of a handwritten diary and a manual for a Kersey Model P-AST-24S Loadstar SCOOP Tractor. The manual details how the Model P-AST-24S was the most recent model in the Kersey SCOOP Tractor collection, and provides specifications, optional equipment, dimensions, and features for that particular model. The photocopy of the handwritten diary consists of 64 pages, with the first entry dated June 2, 1978. Entries frequently include the month, date, and day of the week, with entries for June (16 entries), July (19 entries), and August (9 entries). Topics discussed include working in a non-union mine, daily experiences getting ready for work and working in the mine, and about quitting working at that mine. Three illustrations comprise the final three pages, featuring hand drawn images of equipment, the underground mine layout, and a hand drawn surface site map. Names are redacted through the diary.</p>
