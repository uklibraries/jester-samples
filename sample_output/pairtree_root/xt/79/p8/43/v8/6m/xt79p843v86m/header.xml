          <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The University of Kentucky (UK) Project with Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) at Bandung, Indonesia, had its official beginning on July 2, 1956, when the contract was signed by UK and the United States International Cooperation Administration (ICA).  In 1961, the ICA was succeeded by the United States Agency for International Development (AID). The university unit responsible for carrying out the project was the University of Kentucky Research Foundation (UKRF).  The initial contract was for a three-year period. Eleven years later, on July 31, 1967, the last contract amendment relative to the project expired. According to the contract, the University of Kentucky agreed <emph render="doublequote">to use its best efforts to render such technical advice and assistance to the University of Indonesia as may be appropriate to accelerate and improve the teaching program to increase the general stock of scientific knowledge about engineering problems and the related physical science disciplines.</emph> It further agreed <emph render="doublequote">to lend assistance in the development of an effective program of research, public service, extension, instruction, and graduate study carried on by the Scientific and Technical Faculties and appropriate to the needs of Indonesia.</emph> Financial support of the affiliation was allocated to three major categories of activities, directed toward fulfillment of the objectives set forth in the contract:  1. Provision of technicians, specifically, the members of the Kentucky Contract Team, including professors in mechanical, electrical, metallurgical and mining engineering; architecture; chemistry; physics; and mathematics; and necessary administrative personnel provided by the University of Kentucky. 2. Procurement of commodities, specifically, the equipment required for ITB's education program.  3. Provision of advanced study in the United States for selected Indonesian staff members. Merl Baker was UKRF executive director from 1953-1963 and also served as Director of International Programs, 1955-1963. The Chiefs of Party for the project with ITB were E.B. Penrod (Mechanical Engineering, UK, 1956-1957); E.M. Hammaker (Chemistry, UK, 1957-1959); Clifford R. Keizer (Chemistry, UK, 1959-1961); Vincent E. Nelson (Geology, UK, 1962-1964); and Earl P. Slone (Dean of Pharmacy, UK, 1964-1967).</p><p>The contract AID/W-699 between the University of Kentucky in affiliation with the Institut Pertanian (Agricultural University) Bogor (IPB) began on August 1, 1957 and expired on July 31, 1967.  During this decade, major changes took place in Indonesian higher education and IPB changed its structure. The two loosely knit faculties of the University of Indonesia merged into a progressive, tightly knit, and functional institute of agriculture.  Also during this period, the faculty make up became completely Indonesian.  Over the life of the program, 47 professors and administrative staff members served on the Kentucky team and 218 members of the staff from IPB went to the United States for study or research.  Of that number, 102 earned graduate degrees, with 13 of those being PhD degrees. The Chiefs of Party for the project with IPB (Bogor) were Olaf S. Aaomodt (1958-1960); T.C. Schwan (Chemistry, Valparaiso University, Indiana, 1960-1962); and Howard W. Beers (Rural Sociology, UK, 1962-1966).</p><p>From 1908-1990, UK participated in the Western Universities Agricultural Education Project.</p><p>Historical information written by Antoinette (Toni) Greider, University of Kentucky Libraries Director of International Programs, 2010-2017.</p><p>Sources:

Information about personnel for the project can be found under both the Correspondence and the Personnel Series. Most of the documents in the collection were created and filed by American and Indonesian staff for the project or by ITB and IPB faculty and staff and are written in Indonesian in Latin script or in English in Latin script.  Materials have been minimally processed.  Folders are physically arranged in boxes in the order in which they were received by the UK Special Collections Research Center.  Thus, within the intellectual series and subseries arrangement, box numbers are not consecutive. Original folder titles have been mainly retained.</p>
