      <p>The Drake family of Weybridge, Vermont included Asaph Drake (1776-1871), son of Thomas Drake (1738-1798) and Mary Manley (1742-1839); and Louisa Belding (1770-1854), daughter of David and Lucy Belding. The couple met in 1793 when Drake moved from his family home in Massachusetts to Weybridge to work for David Belding, and married in 1796. Asaph Drake worked in a partnership with his father-in-law and other relatives, providing the people in the surrounding areas with various types of building materials, including wood, brick, stone, and lumber. Together, Asaph and Louisa had nine children: Elijah Graves (1797-1860), Lauren (1800-1869), Isaac (1802-1888), David Belding (1804-1869), Mary Lucy Belding (1806-1881), Sylvia Louisa (1810-1836), Cyrus Bryant (1812-1878), Polly Angeline (1814-1887), and Solomon (1817-1881). Asaph named a number of his children after his own brothers and sisters.</p><p>Many of Asaph and Louisa's children went on to marry and have families of their own as well. Elijah married Harriet Brewster (1799-1863); together they had two daughters, Sarah (1830-1893) and Harriet (b. 1833). Lauren married Rebekah Hurd (1801-1862); together they had two children, Achsa (1830-1899) and Lauren Curtis (1833-1885). Isaac married Mary Williston Brewster (1805-1864), unknown if they had children. David Belding married Caroline Wilson (1860-1865), unknown if the couple had children. Mary Lucy Belding married Thomas D.H. Lake; together the couple had one daughter, Delana Dickinson (1829-1890). Sylvia Louisa never married. Cyrus Bryant married Louisa Maria Smith (1815-1879); together the couple had one child, Louisa Bryant (1843-1930). Polly Angeline married Fordyce M. Shaw (b. 1811), unknown if the couple had any children. Solomon married twice, first to Mary Bangs (1821-1853), and second to Anna Amelia Killum (b. 1843), unknown if Solomon had children with either wife.</p><p>American Letters collector Wade Hall (1934-2015) was a native of Union Springs, Alabama.  Starting in 1962, he lived in Louisville, where he taught English and chaired the English and Humanities/Arts programs at Kentucky Southern College and Bellarmine University.

He held degrees from Troy State University (B.S.), the University of Alabama (M.A.), and the University of Illinois (Ph.D.). He served for two years in the U.S. Army in the mid-fifties.
