Allison Holland for a year, and Lena Scott Flood's last will and testament. The receipts, bills, and checks document purchases made by Mrs. Ellen Howard Morgan and her daughter, Miss Ellen "Nellie" Key Howard Morgan, from businesses in Lexington, Kentucky. Most of the letters are from Carrie B. Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, to her son John Hunt Morgan and his wife Virginia Jeffrey Morgan discussing politics, selling furniture to pay John's debts, news of family, and general updates about her life.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
