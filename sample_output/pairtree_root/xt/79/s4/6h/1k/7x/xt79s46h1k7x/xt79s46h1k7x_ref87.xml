Letters discuss purchases and shipments of goods, payments, land purchases, a new Kentucky statute exempting lunatic asylum workers from jury and militia duty, and hospital regulations. A letter from John W. Hunt's son in law, John H. Hanna, informs Hunt that his daughter Catherine Hunt has a suitor whom he forbade her from seeing until Hunt gives approval (February 8, 1831). Another letter from John W. Hunt to John McKinley discusses Hunt's desire to dissolve their partnership and details of settling accounts (February 15, 1831).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
