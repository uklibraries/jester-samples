The accounts and receipts are for goods purchased by John W. Hunt for his business in trade and general store. The letters are all addressed to John Wesley Hunt in Lexington, Kentucky, and most are from business associates regarding debts and goods to be purchased. One letter from John Adair makes an offer to sell John W. Hunt 12 enslaved persons for 100 pounds including four men (a good carpenter, a hatter, and a man described as beeing as good a distiller and powder maker as any), four women (two of whom are pregnant), and four children, all of which have promised "perfect obedience" (December 19, 1800).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
