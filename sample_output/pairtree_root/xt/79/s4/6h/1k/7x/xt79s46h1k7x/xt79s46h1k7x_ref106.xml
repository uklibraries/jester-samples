Most of the letters are addressed to John Wesley Hunt of Lexington, Kentucky, discussing business matters such as stocks, cattles sales, and a damaged shipment. A letter from Hunt's daughter Mary Hanna discusses family matters and invites him to visit (May 6, 1836). One letter to Charles Howard from R.B. (Roger Brooke) Taney asks Howard to keep an eye on Taney's family since he has been receiving threatening letters concerning a lawsuit he is pursuing (March 6, 1836).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
