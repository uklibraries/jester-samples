Howard frequently asked his wife to send supplies and asked her not to send too detailed letters because the Union censor read everything. A letter from William H. Seward to Major General Nathaniel P. Banks informs him a delegation had met with President Lincoln to request Howard's release and Lincoln left the responsibility with Banks (July 5, 1861). On September 15, 1861, Frank Howard wrote a letter informing his father, Charles Howard, that he had also been arrested by Union soldiers.</p> <p>Folder 5:13 mainly contains letters, the majority of which are either to or from Confederate soldier Charles Howard or his wife, Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard. Most of the letters are between Charles Howard and his wife discussing her life at home, his life in prison and transfers between prisons, and his requests for supplies. A letter to Elizabeth P.K. Howard from her son, Edward Lloyd Howard, informs her of his new position as a surgeon in the Confederate Army (November 12, 1861). Charles Howard wrote a letter to Simon Cameron, the Secretary of War, formally charging Colonel Burke for not inspecting the prison and poor treatment by the officer in charge of it(October 23, 1861).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
