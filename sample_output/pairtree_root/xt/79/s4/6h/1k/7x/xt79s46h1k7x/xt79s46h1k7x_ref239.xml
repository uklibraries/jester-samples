John H. Morgan received many notices from Rettew's Money Loan Office regarding his overdue pledges and sent monthly payments to the United States Loan Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There are also several letters exchanged between Cecil Holland of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and John Hunt Morgan while Morgan was assisting Holland with research for his book about Morgan's uncle and namesake, Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, discussing old records, previous writings about General Morgan, and a debate about General Morgan's highest rank in the Confederate Army.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
