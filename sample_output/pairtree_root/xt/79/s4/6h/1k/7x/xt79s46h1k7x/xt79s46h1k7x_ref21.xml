This first bill of sale (January 1, 1800) is for Deamus, mixed race man who was at the time enslaved by James Buford. John Wesley Hunt paid Isham Talbot $400 for Deamus as part of a settlement in a judgement against William and James Buford. Deamus's mother was a Black woman named Rhoda. Caty, an enslaved Black woman, and her daughter Maria were described to be enslaved for life, and they were sold to John W. Hunt in exchange for 650 pounds of cotton (March 11, 1800). Sam, an enslaved Black twelve-year-old boy, was sold by his enslaver, Joseph Burton, to John Wesley Hunt and Abijah Hunt (March 24, 1800). An enslaved Black woman and her children were sold to J. Talbott by John Wesley Hunt for 100 pounds along with a small sum for goods (January 14, 1800). The woman and her children's names were once known. </p> <p>This folder also contains business letters to John W.
