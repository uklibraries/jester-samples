Hunt; notes of shipments of flour to the Eastern Kentucky Lunatic Asylum; notes of weighing hay; two letters; and shipping lists. The first letter is to Catherine and John Wesley Hunt from their son Abram D. and his wife Ellen Hunt and discusses, among other things, their recent purchase of Eliza, an enslaved woman, and her son (about eight years old) from Colonel McKinley (January 6, 1833). Eliza is an excellent seamstress, washer, and ironer and capable of making an excellent cook. Another letter from James W. Sheffey of Abingdon, Virginia, to Joseph Logan of Lexington, Kentucky, inquires as to the character of the pastor of the 2nd Presbyterian Church in Lexington (March 28, 1833). The shipping lists document a variety of goods shipped to John Wesley Hunt in Lexington, Kentucky, from associates in Louisville, Frankfort, and Maysville, Kentucky. Several shipping lists included salt and/or sugar.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
