Hunt. Letters discuss a lawsuit regarding the purchase of a mule, John Hunt Jr.'s schooling in Ohio, the sale of water damaged goods, note payments, and other various business matters. A letter from Hunt's brother Wilson informs him of the death of their father, Abraham, and includes the contents of the will (November 17, 1821). John W. Hunt's cousin, Hetty Hunt, wrote to ask for a portion of his inheritance since she received nothing in the will despite caring for Abraham while he was ill and the other brothers have agreed to match it (November 20, 1821).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
