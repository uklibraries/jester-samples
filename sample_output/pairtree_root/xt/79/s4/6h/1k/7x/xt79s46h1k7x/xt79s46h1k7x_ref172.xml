Bruce and Kitty G. Hill, a deed between Ellen Key Howard and Frank and McHenry Howard, and an attestation of the marriage of Charlton Morgan and Ellen Key Howard. All but one letter are addressed to members of the linked Morgan and Howard families. Letters to Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard discuss her son Edward Lloyd's struggles to get home to Baltimore, Maryland, and the release of more Confederate prisoners. Martha "Mattie" Morgan wrote to Henrietta Morgan twice commenting on her daughter with the late John Hunt Morgan. A letter from John Breckinridge in Toronto, Canada, to Basil Duke thanks Duke for his account of officers in Kentucky and asks that he and others prepare a report defending themselves against charges of embezzlement and cruelty to Northern prisoners of war. (December 9, 1865).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
