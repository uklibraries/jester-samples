The majority of the letters in this folder were written by Lilian Vaughan Sampson Morgan, who married Thomas Hunt Morgan on June 6, 1904, to her mother-in-law, Mrs. Ellen Morgan, thanking her for her warm welcome and gifts, discussing wedding details, and talking about their work in the biology department at Columbia University. Letters from John Hunt Morgan discuss the family's upcoming cases against lumber companies regarding their illegal use of Morgan properties in Menifee County, Kentucky.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
