Hunt and Thomas Hart Hunt's general store, bills and receipts for goods and services, several bills on John W. Hunt for legal services, and a note of supplies sent to the Eastern Kentucky Lunatic Asylum for which Hunt is a board member. Letters to John Wesley Hunt of Lexington, Kentucky, discuss various business matters such as the order of a piano, the selling of some of Hunt's property, deliveries, bank stock, an insolvent account, draft payments, and debt and rent payments to Hunt. A letter to Hunt from R.S. Woodson of Woodsenville, Kentucky, asks if Woodson's brother can be kept at home rather than being committed to the Eastern Kentucky Lunatic Asylum (August 28, 1836). One letter from David Hunt discusses how expensive it has become to purchase enslaved persons in Mississippi with a going rate of $2500 to $2800 for two people (November 10, 1836).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
