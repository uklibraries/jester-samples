The court orders issued by the Fayette Circuit Court direct the seizure of accounts and property of John Hunt Morgan, Richard C. Morgan, and Thomas Hart Hunt to repay debts (December 23, 1861). A letter sent from a Confederate camp informs John Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, that Colonel Lewis would be pleased to have Morgan and his troops join them (September 17, 1861). Other letters discuss wool purchases, notes coming due, and news of friends.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
