Several pieces of correspondence are either to or from Calvin Cogswell Morgan and/or John Hunt Morgan of Lexington, Kentucky, regarding business matters. A letter to Allen and Calvin Morgan from C.C. Cole of Marion, Kentucky, complains of 23 Black persons enslaved by the Morgans who entered a widow's home and ate all her food and broke her crockery, and Cole asks the Morgans to make restitution (January 22, 1857). In a letter from J.W. White of Memphis, Tennessee, to John H. Morgan he claims the individuals he enslaves are well except for Peter, Bruce, and Howie, and he was recently offered $2500 for Dave, King, and Calvin (February 18, 1857). H.W. Chiles offers to hire and eventually buy 16 to 20 enslaved persons from John H. Morgan to be enslaved on his ship (May 9, 1857). Two letters to John H. Morgan and Calvin C. Morgan and an account statement by Oglesby and Macaulay document the use of persons enslaved by the Morgans on the ship, the Belfast. A receipt from July 11 documents the purchase of enslaved persons for work on the Steamer Northern. A letter from R. Woods to Captain John H. Morgan informs him he is doing very well hiring out enslaved persons in New Orleans, Louisiana, and asks Morgan to send more in the hopes that he will make his fortune there (October 3, 1857), and another letter from R. Woods claims the enslaved persons "seem well satisfied" (November 5, 1857). A letter to John H. Morgan from Thomas H. Noble of Louisville, Kentucky, offers to hire some persons enslaved by Morgan (December 24, 1857).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
