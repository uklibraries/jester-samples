Harcourt as an enslaved man for life at the estate sale of Alexander Fisher. Henry was sold to his new enslaver, John Wesley Hunt of Lexington, Kentucky, for $850 (January 18, 1838).</p> <p>This folder also comprises letters to John Wesley Hunt, receipts for wheat purchases, an account statement, and a bill for clothes and tuition for Hunt's nephew John C. Grosh. Letters to Hunt discuss stocks, dull business, an old promissory note written to Isaac Ward, and a rumor about Canadian loyalists burning Buffalo. Letters from Hunt's children, Mary Hanna, Abram D. Hunt, and Theodosia Strother, discuss their trips to Vicksburg, Mississippi; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Washington, respectively, and a letter from his son Robert Pearson Hunt discusses his progress in school. A letter to John W. Hunt from United States House Representative Richard Hawes responds to Hunt's letter supporting canal building in Wisconsin (April 25, 1838).</p> </scopecontent> </c>
