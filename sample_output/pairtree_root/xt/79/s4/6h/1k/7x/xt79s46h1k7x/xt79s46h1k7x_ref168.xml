All of the letters are written to members of the Hunt-Morgan family or Elizabeth Phoebe Key Howard, a distant relative of the family. Letters written to Elizabeth P.K. Howard of Baltimore, Maryland, discuss details of a project she is working on to remove the Confederate dead from Gettysburg and provide burials for them. Other letters discuss news of family and friends, a business transaction, gifts sent by Henrietta Morgan, and news of the Civil War.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
