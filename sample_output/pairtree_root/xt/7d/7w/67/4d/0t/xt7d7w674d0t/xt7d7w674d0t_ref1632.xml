Some light editing. Page six is missing. This 12 page essay focuses on the efforts that Arnow and Harold took to protect their health while living on their Pulaski County farm. She compares their health while living in town with that of country living, discusses local health services, describes the steps that she and Harold took to maintain bodily comfort, and discusses their diet in considerable detail. Her biggest consternation was a fear of accidents, since the nearest hospital, she explained, was about 110 miles away. The manuscript is in fragile condition; a photocopy is provided as a user copy.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
