The piece as a whole does not have a collective title; folders containing some fragments of the work have titles like <title render="doublequote">Biography of a Body</title>and<title render="doublequote">A Tumor Tale</title> written on their outside, but there is no evidence that these titles are Arnow's own or were ever considered as titles. The version collected in Box 106, Folders 2 and 3, appears to be the version that Arnow worked on last. </p> <p>According to the letter from Arnow to her physician Dr. Kahn on November 18, 1969 (Box 106, Folder 1), the composition of this piece was designed to be therapeutic. Apparently Dr. Kahn read this version of 173 pages and made suggestions for cuts (implying that a secondary purpose of this piece was eventual publication in a magazine or journal). The last of these three letters to Dr. Kahn, dated April 14, 1970, has Arnow mentioning her latest series of edits (cutting 107 pages roughly in half) and her hope that <title render="doublequote">the thing [presumably this piece] will earn some money for the [medical] department. </title>In the April 14th letter, the penciled-in brackets represent proposed cuts, probably by Arnow. In addition there are many interrogatives on the margins, presumably to get Dr. Kahn's input on what to cut or keep. This collaborative effort presents the most polished version of this autobiography, though then UK graduate student Martha Billips, who was the first to review this manuscript in 1986, believed it was less revealing as a result. </p> <p>Marcella Arnow labeled the version in Folders 2 and 3 Version 1 in blue ink on the typescript, but it is certainly not the first version written. Because the revisions seem to have occurred months apart, each version offers a new slant on Arnow's life in the late 1960s, a period marked not only by illnesses (a pituitary tumor, a bladder infection, an ulcer, several vision problems and a marked slide into depression) but by her children leaving home and endless revisions of<title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter.</title> Following this argument, it stands to reason that the earlier versions offer a more immediate, fuller depiction of her life. For this reason, all attempts have been made to piece together complete versions of each section and present each version as a separate, unique entity, rather than a rejected draft. Because of large gaps in some versions, it was necessary to piece together carbons and originals within a version in order to present a narrative whole. It may be possible that some pages of this piece are on the back sides of other manuscripts, just as drafts of <title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter,</title>original correspondence and notes for speeches (all of which have been photocopied) appear in these drafts. </p> <p>The raw materials of this autobiography have been rearranged in reverse chronological order; the reader can work backwards, from the 1970 version commissioned by Dr. Kahn, through its various (and varying) editions, to the initial journal, which recounts events dating back to 1960. Before Dr. Kahn's input, however, Arnow apparently had a design in mind as far as presentation of this autobiography. The piece moves chronologically through four sections. Only the versions in Folders 2 and 3 and Folders 4 and 5 are presented together as a whole, since they are the only drafts where all four sections were found together. Where a correspondence between sections can be inferred in other versions, it is mentioned below. For this reason, all versions of Section I (save the Dr. Kahn versions) are collected together, in reverse chronological order, then Section II, and so on. Roughly speaking, Section I, titled <title render="doublequote">Old Age</title> in later drafts, is a retrospective, self-penned medical history up to about 1964, with descriptions of her health before and after the births of her children. Section II, <title render="doublequote">Decrepitude</title>, seems to be a contemporaneous account of her condition between March 1966 and January 1967, after leaving the hospital for treatment of her vision problems (an early symptom of her tumor). Two interesting anomalies in this collection relate to this section. First, an early draft titled 1966 exists, which may have been written before the four-section schema of this piece was formulated. Second, the piece found in Box 107, Folder 9, relates the same experiences as <title render="doublequote">Decrepitude</title> but in a more detached style, without specific names and places, suggesting strongly that Arnow may have contemplated turning this experience into a short story. <title render="doublequote">Metempsychosis</title>, Section III, is a contemporaneous account of her surgery and recovery from a pituitary tumor. Its earlier versions also offer some of the most unflinching portrayals of her mental condition at the time; perhaps for this reason, it is one of the more heavily reworked sections. Though no drafts name any names, Martha Billips believes the early drafts recount a trip Arnow made to a writer's workshop at Morehead State University in the company of James Still. Arnow moves this episode to Section II in her last version. Section IV is alternately titled <title render="doublequote">Temporary Backsets</title> and <title render="doublequote">Temporary Backset;</title> whether this subtle change was intentional or erroneous is unknown. </p> <p>As with the other three sections, various undated versions exist, without any clear indications as to their origins and order. Some strong hints exist, however: because the handwritten emendations to the draft in Box 107, Folder 7 show up in the typescript in Folder 6, for example, we can make an educated guess that the Folder 7 version was written first. Also notable is the shift of narrative tone: one need only to compare the final paragraphs of the two aforementioned versions to trace the decline from optimism to undisguised despair, finally resolving in the benign, resigned tone of the Box 106, Folder 3, version. Much of this anxiety regarding her surroundings and the state of the nation circa 1969-70 also found its way into Arnow's fiction at this time--<title render="italic">The Weedkiller's Daughter</title> and the unpublished <title render="italic">To You No Place</title>.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1635" level="file"/> <c id="ref1636" level="file"/> <c id="ref1637" level="file"/> <c id="ref1638" level="file"/> <c id="ref1639" level="file"/> <c id="ref1640" level="file"/> <c id="ref1641" level="file"/> <c id="ref1642" level="file"/> <c id="ref1643" level="file"/> <c id="ref1644" level="file"/> <c id="ref1645" level="file"/> <c id="ref1646" level="file"/> <c id="ref1647" level="file"/> <c id="ref1648" level="file"/> <c id="ref1649" level="file"/> <c id="ref1650" level="file"/> <c id="ref1651" level="file"/> <c id="ref1652" level="file"/> <c id="ref1653" level="file"/> <c id="ref1654" level="file"/> <c id="ref1655" level="file"/> <c id="ref1656" level="file"/> <c id="ref1657" level="file"/> <c id="ref1658" level="file"/> <c id="ref1659" level="file"/> <c id="ref1660" level="file"/> <c id="ref1661" level="file"/> </c>
