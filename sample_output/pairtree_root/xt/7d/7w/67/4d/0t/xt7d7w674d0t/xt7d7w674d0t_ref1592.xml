Marcella Arnow's handwriting in blue ink on each of the photocopies indicates that she provided the photocopies while retaining the originals, which are not part of this collection. While many of the notices are the standard form letters, several notices include constructive criticism, indicating that Arnow's work was being read by publishers. Especially notable is the March 1934 rejection slip from Hal Roach Studios (then a major Hollywood Studio) for a work entitled <title render="doublequote">Calf Money.</title> Because there is no draft of that work, it is unknown whether this was Arnow's own screenplay, an idea for a screenplay, or possibly connected to her short story <title render="doublequote">The Lamb Money.</title> Also, there are three brief rejection notices from <title render="italic">Southern Review</title> (subsequent to her publication of <title render="doublequote">The Washerwoman's Day</title> in that magazine) from editor Robert Penn Warren. These notices are arranged alphabetically by magazine and include the following: <title render="italic">American Prefaces</title>, <title render="italic">The Anvil</title>, <title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title>, <title render="italic">Esquire</title>, <title render="italic">Frontier and Midland</title>, <title render="italic">Kosmos</title>, <title render="italic">Manuscript</title>, <title render="italic">The New Talent/Advance Guard Quarterly</title>, Hal Roach Studios, <title render="italic">Southern Review</title>, and <title render="italic">Sweetheart Stories/Dell Publishing</title>. Marcella Arnow also provided photocopies of form rejection letters from The Frank A. Munsey Company, L<title render="italic">ove Novels Magazine</title>, <title render="italic">The Farmer's Wife</title>, Street and Smith Publications, McFadden Publications (<title render="italic">Liberty</title>), <title render="italic">Story</title>, Munsey Publications, and <title render="italic">The Saturday Evening Post</title>.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
