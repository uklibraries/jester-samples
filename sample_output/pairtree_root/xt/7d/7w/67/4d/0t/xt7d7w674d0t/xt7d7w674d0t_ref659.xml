Most notebooks correspond, at least in part, to the published first edition. Box 54 also includes notebooks relating to <title render="doublequote">Dollmaker's Children </title>and the [cat on roof story]. The word <title render="doublequote">done</title> in pencil on the cover of various notebooks appears to be Harold Arnow's indication that he had typed the notebook. There is child's scribbling throughout notebooks. The Roman numerals on the notebooks were given by HSA. Some notebooks are missing according to the Roman numerals, so they have been renumbered in brackets to provide uniformity. When a photocopy has been provided, the original should not be used due to its delicate condition.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref660" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref681" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref699" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref725" level="subseries"/> </c>
