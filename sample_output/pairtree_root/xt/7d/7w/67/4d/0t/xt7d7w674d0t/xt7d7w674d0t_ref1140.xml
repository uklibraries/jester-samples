Knopf. The many versions and variants of <title render="italic">The Kentucky Trace</title> arrived at the University of Kentucky in disarray. With a few exceptions, pages were not in sequential order, and different versions and different formats (original typescript and carbon) were mixed together. Although certain pages apparently follow in sequence, it was not always clear with which version a fragment belonged. Moreover, many pages were missing. Arnow often used the reverse side of apparently discarded pages from one work to type something else. For example, some pages of <title render="italic">The Kentucky Trace</title> were typed on the backs of correspondence and drafts of essays, and vice versa. In these cases, the original was photocopied and kept with the material where it was found, and the photocopy was placed in the appropriate file. </p> <p>In an attempt to make the many fragments of the novel more accessible, they were grouped as Early Drafts, Middle Draft, Late Draft, and Final Draft. The Early Drafts have been sorted into versions, an arrangement which does not necessarily represent Arnow's own order of sequence; she certainly did not designate her drafts by using these terms. The parts were pieced together by an educated guess at what their original and appropriate order may have been. Arnow quite possibly did not think of some of the sequences as integral versions but rather as reworkings of a particular part of the novel. Precisely when Arnow began working on the novel is unclear. In a letter dated July 23, 1971, Harold Strauss queried her, asking <title render="doublequote">Are you . . . working on a book now? If so, what is it, and when do you expect to finish it?</title> In a letter from Arnow to Strauss dated September 12, 1972, she apologizes for the time she's taken to finish the manuscript, which, she says, still does not have a <title render="doublequote">suitable name.</title> Six months later, on March 7, 1973, Arnow wrote to Strauss to tell him that a draft of about 105,000 words will be on its way to him shortly (the Middle Draft likely represents this draft). Strauss's assistant at Knopf acknowledged receipt of the manuscript on March 28, 1973. After extensively revising portions of the novel during the next several months (see the Knopf correspondence file, Box 32, Folder 2, for discussion between author and editor/s), the novel appeared in publication in June 1974. Much of the revision between the first submission and the final typescript centered on the initial and especially the closing chapters of the novel. The many revision attempts of various pages and sections comprise the Late Draft, which is not, in itself, a whole draft. The Final Draft is composed of the extant pages, mostly carbons, that closely match the published version.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1141" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1149" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1184" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1210" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1224" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1244" level="subseries"/> </c>
