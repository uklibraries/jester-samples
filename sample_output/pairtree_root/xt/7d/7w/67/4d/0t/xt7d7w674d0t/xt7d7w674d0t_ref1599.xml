It is unpublished except for two short excerpts (see Box 105, Folder 14). By all indications, the manuscript was written starting at the end of the summer of 1939. At this time Arnow and her husband Harold had recently purchased and moved onto an abandoned farm on Little Indian Creek on the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River in Pulaski County, Kentucky. This autobiographical essay, 179 pages in length and written in a journal style, describes, in colorful, personal imagery, the pleasures and trials of living in close association with the land and its seasons, and sharing with neighbors the challenges and amusements of day-to-day rural life. The first entry is dated August 31, the last entry September 1 [1940]. This appears to be an original manuscript, although pages 1-3 are probably carbons. Most of the manuscript is in very fragile condition; each folder contains a photocopy, which is the user copy. Special Collections holds only one version of this manuscript and as far as is known no subsequent versions exist.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1600" level="file"/> <c id="ref1601" level="file"/> <c id="ref1602" level="file"/> <c id="ref1603" level="file"/> <c id="ref1604" level="file"/> <c id="ref1605" level="file"/> <c id="ref1606" level="file"/> <c id="ref1607" level="file"/> <c id="ref1608" level="file"/> <c id="ref1609" level="file"/> <c id="ref1610" level="file"/> <c id="ref1611" level="file"/> <c id="ref1612" level="file"/> <c id="ref1613" level="file"/> <c id="ref1614" level="file"/> <c id="ref1615" level="file"/> <c id="ref1616" level="file"/> <c id="ref1617" level="file"/> <c id="ref1618" level="file"/> <c id="ref1619" level="file"/> <c id="ref1620" level="file"/> <c id="ref1621" level="file"/> <c id="ref1622" level="file"/> <c id="ref1623" level="file"/> <c id="ref1624" level="file"/> <c id="ref1625" level="file"/> <c id="ref1626" level="file"/> <c id="ref1627" level="file"/> <c id="ref1628" level="file"/> <c id="ref1629" level="file"/> </c>
