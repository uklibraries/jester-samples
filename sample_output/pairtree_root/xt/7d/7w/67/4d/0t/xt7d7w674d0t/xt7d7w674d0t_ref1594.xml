It is unclear if she attempted to publish many pieces on her own. The two known published pieces in this collection, <title render="doublequote">To Know the Rain </title>and <title render="doublequote">Ode to a Purple Aluminum Christmas Tree</title>, are listed as found poems by Ronald W. Butler, suggesting that they were originally published elsewhere. A rejection slip from <title render="italic">Kosmos</title> mentions <title render="doublequote">Logic</title> as being <title render="doublequote">amusing</title> (Box 103, Folder 7). Because most of the rejection slips are form letters, it is difficult to assess which are for short fiction and which are for poetry.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1595" level="file"/> <c id="ref1596" level="file"/> </c>
