The typescripts are undated, but correspondence with Harold Strauss suggests that she sent the drafts for editing in late 1936 and early 1937. Arnow almost discontinued work on the novel after frustrations with criticisms from Mr. Strauss according to a letter dated circa early August 1937 (Box 30, Folder 1). In October 1938, Mr. Strauss left Covici-Friede and forwarded <title render="italic">Between the Flowers</title> to Alfred Knopf, for whom later Mr. Strauss would work and HSA would publish. In December 1938 (Box 30, Folder 1), Mr. Strauss wrote to Arnow, informing her that Mr. Knopf had declined to publish <title render="italic">Between the Flowers</title>. One of Arnow's friends offered to publish the novel through his small, independent publishing company (Box 30, Folder 1); Mr. Strauss requested that she avoid this route, and he continued to send her manuscript to several publishers over the next few years, to no avail.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref616" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref622" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref629" level="subseries"/> </c>
