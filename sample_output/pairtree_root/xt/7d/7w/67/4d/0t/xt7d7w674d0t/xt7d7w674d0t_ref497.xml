She also served as Chairwoman of Mayor's Unemployment Committee, Director of Detroit Housing Commission, Director of Women's Personnel at Willow Run Bomber Plant during World War II, and Director of Detroit Atheist Society. Gomon was a founding member of Planned Parenthood and both national and Detroit chapters of the ACLU. While there is no evidence from the letters as to how their friendship began, it is likely Arnow and Josephine met while working at the Willow Run Bomber Plant. The Arnows and Gomon lived relatively close to one another, and Marcella Arnow seems to be a frequent visitor to Gomon's apartment.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref498" level="file"/> <c id="ref499" level="file"/> <c id="ref500" level="file"/> <c id="ref501" level="file"/> <c id="ref502" level="file"/> <c id="ref503" level="file"/> <c id="ref504" level="file"/> <c id="ref505" level="file"/> <c id="ref506" level="file"/> <c id="ref507" level="file"/> <c id="ref508" level="file"/> <c id="ref509" level="file"/> <c id="ref510" level="file"/> <c id="ref511" level="file"/> </c>
