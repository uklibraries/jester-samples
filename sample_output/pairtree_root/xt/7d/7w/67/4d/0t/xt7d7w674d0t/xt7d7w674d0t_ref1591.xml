Unnumbered first page, p. 1-15, 30-33, and 36. Missing p. 34-35. Two pages, unnumbered, clipped separately, are part of the piece and possibly could be its beginning. Narrative has characteristics similar to <title render="italic">The Dollmaker</title>: tensions and differences between <title render="doublequote">hillbillies</title> and others living in <title render="doublequote">the alley</title> in likely Detroit during World War II figure prominently in this story. Characters include Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Lawson, Mrs. Shopinsky (?), and the Prossers.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
