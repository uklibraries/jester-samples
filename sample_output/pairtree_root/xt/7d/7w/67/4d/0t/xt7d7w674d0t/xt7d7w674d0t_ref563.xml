While these fragments may have similarity in passing to sections of the Later draft or the Typescript Version, they mostly represent rejected plot developments or episodes later superseded by the Later draft. There is no correspondence between the numbering of these drafts and the numbering in the Typescript Version; in the case of a page that HSA renumbered by hand, the later, handwritten page number is referred to below. Because these fragments are brief and provide few clues as to their interrelation, they have all been arranged in numerical order. It should be stressed that these fragments do not come from the same drafts but are the only surviving remains of heavy authorial revision.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref564" level="file"/> <c id="ref565" level="file"/> </c>
