Following her usual drafting process, Arnow wrote this first draft in notebooks and then typed them (or perhaps had her husband or someone else type them), sometimes making slight revisions or commentary in the running text during the transcription. Some notebooks and portions of the typescript of Version A are missing. Plot events are similar to the published version, but some names are different (most notably, Watson in this version is Leslie in subsequent versions).</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1142" level="file"/> <c id="ref1143" level="file"/> <c id="ref1144" level="file"/> <c id="ref1145" level="file"/> <c id="ref1146" level="file"/> <c id="ref1147" level="file"/> <c id="ref1148" level="file"/> </c>
