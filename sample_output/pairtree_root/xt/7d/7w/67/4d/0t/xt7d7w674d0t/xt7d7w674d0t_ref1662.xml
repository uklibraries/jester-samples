The slender volume (less than 150 pages in its first edition) is both a history of Burnside and a series of Arnow's recollections of her childhood in the Pulaski County town. Like so many of her other works, <title render="italic">Old Burnside</title> saw many changes over the course of its composition, often due to author-publisher disputes. Invited by the publisher to expand the historical background in the book, Arnow, after undertaking extensive research and revision of the original typescript, produced a work reminiscent of her Cumberland social histories and more in-depth than her publishers intended. After some sharply worded letters from Arnow and an unfinished attempt at condensing the history, the final typescript and the published version isolated the historical material to Chapters 1 and 2. The personal history that makes up the remainder of the work was also edited down. As a result, the published version seems to be a compromise between author and publisher, with the publisher winning out. </p> <p>The materials in this collection offer a glimpse of Arnow's original intentions for <title render="italic">Old Burnside</title>. Due to the aforementioned incomplete versions of the book and a cut-and-paste version (Box 109, Folders 2-12) in which the unused remnants were likely discarded, the collection for <title render="italic">Old Burnside</title> has more fragments and loose pages than most of Arnow's other works. While it is possible that interstitial pages connecting the fragments may be found in the unprocessed pages of this collection, it is more likely that these fragments are a lasting result of several drastic revisions and reworkings. Also, it should be noted that Arnow used a mixture of Roman and Arabic numerals to number the chapters over the course of composition. For the sake of consistency, this inventory, in accordance with the published work, uses Arabic numerals. </p> <p>A number of letters in the publisher correspondence, Box 32, Folder 4, detail Arnow's experience with the University Press of Kentucky in writing this novel. William Jerome Crouch (signing his name as Wm. Jerome Crouch in correspondence) first approached Arnow with the proposal to write a Burnside memoir for the bicentennial bookshelf series in 1972. After a few years of tense letters, Arnow comments in early 1975 <title render="doublequote">the best thing to be done is forget <title render="italic">Old Burnside</title>.</title> Later in the year (September 8, 1975), Bruce Denbo explains that the UPK cannot enter into a contract until after the board has approved her manuscript. The next year (June 15, 1976), Mr. Denbo asks that Arnow condense the historical section of her work to only twelve pages, a request which leaves Arnow <title render="doublequote">grieved and shocked</title> and comments that she <title render="doublequote">would prefer a rejection</title> (June 30, 1976). Mr. Denbo and Arnow arrived at a compromise wherein she would remove the political and military history but leave the rest. </p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1663" level="file"/> <c id="ref1664" level="file"/> <c id="ref1665" level="file"/> <c id="ref1666" level="file"/> <c id="ref1667" level="file"/> </c>
