The novel grew out of the unpublished short story <title render="doublequote">A Journey for Lucinda</title>, though the lack of a date on the manuscript prevents one from knowing when the novel was commenced or how soon the novel followed the short story (<title render="doublequote">Lucinda </title>was submitted to Arnow's literary agent, Henry Volkening in January 1954, Box 33, Folder 3). In keeping with her usual work habits, Arnow often used the back of personal letters, early drafts and typescript notes to both <title render="italic">Seedtime on the Cumberland </title>and <title render="italic">Flowering of the Cumberland</title> in the composition of the <title render="italic">To You No Place </title>typescript. In these cases, the original was photocopied, then the photocopy placed within the <title render="italic">To You No Place</title> typescript, while the photocopy of a letter was placed within the appropriate correspondence box, photocopies of drafts were placed with fellow drafts and so on. </p> <p>The last known typescript of <title render="italic">To You No Place </title>(known here as Version A) was given to Special Collections preserved in a cardboard box, complete and in order. All other drafts of the novel and short story arrived at Special Collections unsorted, with pages of separate drafts commingling. Because Arnow numbers each page, though, it was possible to piece together a running order for all drafts. In addition to the two latest workings of the novel (Versions A and B), there is an earlier version dating from around 1961, referred to here as Version C. In a self-deprecating letter to the author and editor John Leggett on October 19, 1961, Arnow describes her submission of this version to Macmillan, who, she says,<title render="doublequote"> rejected it with vehement speed</title>. Though she goes on to say in the letter that she <title render="doublequote">cannot say it would have merit</title>, it appears from this submission to Leggett and her two subsequent reworkings of the novel that she did have some publication hopes for this novel. Both <title render="doublequote">A Journey for Lucinda</title> and <title render="italic">To You No Place</title> are resolutely works-in-progress. </p> <p>The manuscript of <title render="doublequote">A Journey for Lucinda</title> includes three distinct beginnings (plus a fragment with a fourth beginning) as well as three distinct endings. An educated guess was made in surmising the causal link between the three drafts: handwritten emendations to the first draft (draft A) became part of draft B and draft B's emendations find their way onto draft C's typescript. One should not assume, however, that draft C was Arnow's intended final version or that it is the version she submitted to Henry Volkening. As for the novel, its genesis probably lies in Box 76, Folder 5, which has fragments of <title render="doublequote">A Journey for Lucinda</title>. The numbers in parentheses in the typescript are Arnow's own references to the corresponding manuscript page. Where a correspondence, even a rough one, between manuscript and typescript can be established, it is noted below. For reasons unknown, the final typescript of the novel (Version A) lacks a corresponding set of drafts and notes, while only fragments of Version C have been retrieved from the backs of her everyday correspondence. With the exception of Versions A and C of <title render="italic">To You No Place</title>, both the story and novel are composed on very cheap, fragile paper: either a coarse, newspaper-type paper or a brittle, tissue-thin paper. Unfortunately, due to prohibitive cost, all of these pages cannot be photocopied for use in these collections. Therefore, appropriate care must be taken when perusing and handling these materials. </p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1088" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1097" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1119" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1122" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref1130" level="subseries"/> </c>
