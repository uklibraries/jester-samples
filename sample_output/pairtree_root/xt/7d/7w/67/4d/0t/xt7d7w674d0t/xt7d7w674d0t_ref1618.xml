Arnow's pagination starting at page 95-0 does not make sense. The page has been rearranged so that the error will not confuse future readers. The corrected pagination goes as follows: Follow Arnow's pagination through page 96. At that point what Arnow labeled page 99-1 becomes page [96-1]; what was the backside of 99-1 becomes [96-2]; Arnow's page 95-0 becomes [97-1]; the backside of 95-0 becomes [97-2]; what Arnow called 97-1 becomes [98-1]; what was the backside of 97-1 becomes [98-2]. What Arnow labeled 98-1 becomes [99-1], and what was the backside of 98-1 becomes [99-2]. From there the pagination returns to Arnow's page 100-1. Arnow's entry of March 30 seems to be a typo and was probably intended to be March 3.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
