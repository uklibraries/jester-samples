This 12 page essay, written 18 months after Arnow and Harold arrived at the farm, takes stock of their experiences up to that time. The title conveys the basic theme of the essay, which is that their expectations and plans regarding country living had to be modified and made more realistic. Apparently one of the reasons they moved to the country was to have more time to write, but the demands of farm and household resulted at best in their writing no more than they did when living in town. Arnow describes the various chores that she and Harold had to do, and reflects on the differences between country and city living, particularly as they affect what Arnow calls their standard of living, although she uses the term to apply to more than simply income. The manuscript is in fragile condition; a photocopy is provided as a user copy.</p> </scopecontent> </c>
