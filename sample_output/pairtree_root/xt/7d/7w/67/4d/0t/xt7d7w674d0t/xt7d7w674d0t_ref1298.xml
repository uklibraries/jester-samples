Some of the pages in this draft have been renumbered or numbered twice, and it is not always clear which numbering sequence should be followed. Because of the ambiguity of this double numbering, a fragment which originally may have been part of the Version A.1 sequence has been designated Early Draft, Version B.1 (p. 49-72, 75-87). There are text and notes on the reverse side of some pages in the early drafts. Early Draft, Version C.1 includes p. 99-124, 175-256 (chapters IV and VI). Early Draft, Version D.1 (p. 1-51, 64-107, with p. 64-91 renumbered 40-66; including chapter II) incorporates some changes from Early Draft, Version A.1. Early Draft, Version E.1 includes p. 216-370 (chapters X-XIII). Early Draft, Version E.2 (381-721, 735-861, 935, 1028-1073) appears to follow Version E.1. Most of Version E.2 was not used in the published version. Some pages in E.2 have notes indicating where and when the page was written. Version E.2 contains a few photocopies of hand written pages that were found with but do not fit into this sequence. Because of the renumbered pages and because it is not clear where Early Draft, Version F.1 and Early Draft, Version G.1 should fit in the sequence of Early Drafts, these two fragments have been kept separate. Early Draft, Version F.1 (p.6-26) is dated June 17, 1964 on p. 26. A note on p. 33 of Early Draft, Version G.1 (p. 37-63 renumbered p. 12-39) dates that fragment on Aug. 4. Early Draft Fragments Folder 19 contains numbered and unnumbered pages that belong with the early drafts but do not clearly fit into a particular sequence. One reason for the difficulty in linking pages was that there are many pages missing. Correspondence between some but not all of these fragments and the published version have been established. Correspondence between the various Early Draft versions and chapters in the published version have been noted. When a photocopy has been provided, the original should not be used due to its delicate condition. Roman numeral chapter numbers were given by Arnow.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref1299" level="file"/> <c id="ref1300" level="file"/> <c id="ref1301" level="file"/> <c id="ref1302" level="file"/> <c id="ref1303" level="file"/> <c id="ref1304" level="file"/> <c id="ref1305" level="file"/> <c id="ref1306" level="file"/> <c id="ref1307" level="file"/> <c id="ref1308" level="file"/> <c id="ref1309" level="file"/> <c id="ref1310" level="file"/> <c id="ref1311" level="file"/> <c id="ref1312" level="file"/> <c id="ref1313" level="file"/> <c id="ref1314" level="file"/> <c id="ref1315" level="file"/> <c id="ref1316" level="file"/> <c id="ref1317" level="file"/> <c id="ref1318" level="file"/> <c id="ref1319" level="file"/> <c id="ref1320" level="file"/> <c id="ref1321" level="file"/> <c id="ref1322" level="file"/> <c id="ref1323" level="file"/> <c id="ref1324" level="file"/> <c id="ref1325" level="file"/> <c id="ref1326" level="file"/> <c id="ref1327" level="file"/> <c id="ref1328" level="file"/> <c id="ref1329" level="file"/> <c id="ref1330" level="file"/> </c>
