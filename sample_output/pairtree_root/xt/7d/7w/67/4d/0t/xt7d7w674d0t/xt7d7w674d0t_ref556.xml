What is represented here is incomplete and far from polished. As noted before, it is conceivable (likely, perhaps) that an intermediate typescript draft exists that was either lost, destroyed, not donated to Special Collections, or parceled out by HSA in cut-and-paste versions. The reader is left to deal with surviving fragments that suggest, rather than make evident, HSA's intentions. Like the notebooks, typescript drafts are categorized by Special Collections into Earlier, Early and Later Drafts. This categorization is done for the sake of convenience; the reader is cautioned, however, that: 1) each category probably contains the remainder of several drafts, given the fact that HSA did not revise the entire work (or an entire chapter) every time she made revisions, but wrote and edited in sections. The large gaps between sections make subcategorizing impossible; 2) HSA made numerous, heavy revisions to some episodes, while some episodes appear largely unchanged from the initial typescript. For this reason, there may be three <title render="doublequote">Later</title> versions of one episode or chapter and only one of the next chapter; and 3) The distinction between Early and Later Drafts is an arbitrary one made for the sake of this collection. The dividing line is the point in which the <title render="doublequote">Beulah</title> and <title render="doublequote">Dave</title> characters of the notebooks have their names changed to <title render="doublequote">Victoria</title> and <title render="doublequote">Dave</title>, respectively. This change not only occurs at a convenient midway point in the novel's composition, but also signals a shift in tone and direction that is reflected in the Typescript Version.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref557" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref563" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref566" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref578" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref582" level="subseries"/> </c>
