          <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Born in Wayne County, Kentucky, Harriette Simpson Arnow (1908-1986) grew up in the rugged foothills of the Appalachians, where the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River emerges from the East Kentucky Coalfield. Arnow's parents, Mollie Jane Denney and Elias Thomas Simpson, were schoolteachers before having their six children. After attending Berea College, Arnow became a teacher herself, at a one-room school in Pulaski County, Kentucky. In 1931, she earned a BS in education from the University of Louisville and taught until she moved to Cincinnati in 1934. In Cincinnati, as Arnow was writing her first novel, <title render="italic">Mountain Path</title>, she also worked as a waitress and typist and, eventually, as a writer for the Works Progress Administration, where she met journalist Harold Arnow. They married in 1939 and moved to Keno, Kentucky, to write and farm. During World War II, they moved to Detroit where Harold took a job at the Detroit Times and Harriette finished Hunter's Horn. The Arnows had two children, Marcella and Thomas.
       
      Arnow's  parents and grandparents were storytellers, inspiring Harriette to become a writer. She published short stories, five novels, and three works of non-fiction from the 1930s to 1977.  Her acclaimed and best-selling novels, <title render="italic">Hunter's Horn</title> (1949) and <title render="italic">The Dollmaker</title> (1954), are part of a Kentucky trilogy that includes <title render="italic">Mountain Path</title> (1936).  In these works of fiction, Arnow explores how the social and economic fabric of rural Kentucky hill communities in the first half of the 20th century was changed by the coming of roads, electricity, and the World Wars.  Arnow also completed two social histories, <title render="italic">Seedtime on the Cumberland</title> (1960) and <title render="italic">Flowering of the Cumberland</title> (1963), which examine the settlement of the Cumberland River Valley at the end of the 18th century, as well as a memoir, <title render="italic">Old Burnside</title> (1977), that focuses on her childhood in Pulaski County, Kentucky.  Two final novels, <title render="italic">Weedkiller's Daughter</title> and <title render="italic">The Kentucky Trace: A Novel of the American Revolution</title> were published in the early 1970s. She died in Michigan in 1986.  A collection of short stories and a novel, <title render="italic">Between the Flowers</title>, were released posthumously.</p>

        <p>The Photographs Series contains 337 images from the 1930s-1980s. It consists of prints, negatives, slides and postcards. Comprised in the series are family snapshots, publicity head shots, photographs from writing workshops and occasions when Arnow won awards, photographs collected by Arnow for research purposes for <title render="italic">Seedtime on the Cumberland</title> and <title render="italic">Flowering of the Cumberland</title>, and photos from Arnow's funeral.  There are also portraits of three authors, James Dickey, William Styron, and Tennessee Williams, that were taken for inclusion in <title render="italic">Images of the Southern Writer</title> by Mark Morrow, 1985. Arnow is not included in the book, although Morrow corresponded with her (see March 2, 1981 letter, Box 37, Folder 18) and he sent her the images of the other authors. </p>
        <p>The majority of the photographs are family snapshots of Harriette, her husband Harold, her son Tom and her daughter Marcella taken mostly in Michigan. There are several photographs of the family when they lived in a World War II housing project in Detroit and also several shots of the family at their home on Nixon Road in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many of the photos feature Harriette and the children, and seem to have been taken by Harold.  Also included in this series are photographs of Harriette's mother, sisters, brother, and other relatives on her side. </p>
        <p>There are not many photographs that appear to have been taken in Kentucky, excluding Arnow's funeral. Arnow died in 1986 and she was cremated. Her ashes were buried next to Harold's grave in Keno. Harold died the previous year, February 20, 1985. The urn with her remains and the placing of the urn in the woods are documented in these photos.</p>
