In the margins or end pages of these notebooks she would often list or revise characters' names, make note of historical references or books to look up, or make personal notes and reminders. Though numerous, these notebooks do not reflect the whole of the <title render="italic">Belle</title> typescript, nor do they have much correspondence with the typescript. Only about one-third of the <title render="italic">Belle</title> typescript can be traced back to the notebooks in this collection and only then in significantly altered form. Whether HSA changed her method and composed on a typewriter, whether notebooks have been destroyed or misplaced or whether other notebooks exist is unknown. In any case, the notebooks in this collection have no continuity between them and serve mainly to represent the embryonic stages of the novel. The notebooks arranged here are in three categories: Very Early drafts, Early drafts and Later drafts (these distinctions were not made by HSA herself). The Very Early drafts are those that have only the vaguest resemblance to the typescript; sometimes the mention of the Civil War is the only indication we have that these drafts are related to the larger work. Early notebooks are closer to the typescript but differ in major respects. The biggest hint as to the relative date of the Early and Later notebook are the characters' names. <title render="doublequote">Victoria</title>, <title render="doublequote">Jean Paul</title>, <title render="doublequote">Dave</title>, and <title render="doublequote">Akhim </title>in the Later draft and most typescript drafts were <title render="doublequote">Beulah</title>, <title render="doublequote">Dave</title>, <title render="doublequote">Dwight</title> and <title render="doublequote">Achen </title>in the Early notebooks and the earliest typescript drafts. To avoid confusion, one should make note of the two different characters alternately named <title render="doublequote">Dave</title>. In the early stages of the manuscript HSA apparently had not arrived at names for some of her minor characters; they are either dubbed <title render="doublequote">Name</title> or signified by two dashes.</p> </scopecontent> <c id="ref532" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref535" level="subseries"/> <c id="ref549" level="subseries"/> </c>
