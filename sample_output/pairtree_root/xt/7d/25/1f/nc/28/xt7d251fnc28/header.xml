      <p>O. Leonard founded the Kentucky Educational Television (KET) broadcast network in 1962. KET is a state network of PBS member television stations that broadcast national programming and local programming geared largely toward education. Press acted as the executive director of KET from its founding until his retirement during 1991. Leonard Press published a book about his time at KET titled <title render="italic">The KET Story: A Personal Account</title> during 2008.</p><p>Press was born in Massachusetts during 1921. He developed an interest in writing, radio, and television throughout his adolescence. He later secured a master's degree in communications at Boston University College of Communications (Kentucky Educational Television, 2020). Boston University hired Press to manage all radio and television spots for the university and, after graduating, Press decided that he wanted to continue to work in television (ibid.). He joined the University of Kentucky's broadcasting department as a faculty member. There, while working with his colleagues producing different programs throughout Kentucky, Press realized the way unequal resources acted as a barrier to equal education across Kentucky (Kentucky Educational Television, 2019c). Press made it his mission to use the power of television in order to improve education not only in rural Kentucky, but throughout the Commonwealth. In 1962, the Kentucky General Assembly named Press as the first executive director of the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television (Kentucky Educational Television, 2019a). KET aired its first broadcast during 1968 (ibid.). Under Press' leadership, KET grew from initially only broadcasting during school hours o' weekdays, to broadcasting seven days a week, creating original telecourses, marketing education programs nationally, and developing distance learning services (ibid.). </p><p>KET continued to flourish after Press's retirement during 1991. In the decades following, KET developed new distance learning technologies, hosted statewide literacy campaigns, and launched a children's channel (ibid.). The cause that Press founded KET for, to improve education in the Commonwealth, continues to be the core mission of KET (Kentucky Educational Television, 2019c).</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Kentucky Educational Television.
