      <p>The University of Kentucky is the flagship, land-grant university for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, located in Lexington, Kentucky. It was established by an Act of the Legislature in 1865 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky University (now Transylvania University). Classes began on the estates of Ashland and Woodlands in Lexington, Ky., in October 1866.  In 1878, the Legislature split A&amp;M College from Kentucky University, and it became State College. Between 1878 and 1882, State College rented its former campus from Kentucky University.  In February 1882, classes began on its current home on 52 acres of land donated by the city of Lexington.  In 1908, the Legislature changed the name from State College to State University. In 1916, the Legislature again changed the name from State University to University of Kentucky.</p><p>Source:  <title render="doublequote">UK Chronology.</title> University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections Research Center website. https://libraries.uky.edu/libpage.php?lweb_id=311&amp;llib_id=13</p>

      <p>The University of Kentucky. Land Acquisition Files and Reports (dated 1950-1992; 1 cubic foot; 1 record storage carton) comprise transcriptions of, indeces to, and computerized reports of deeds and other <title render="doublequote">land acquisition files</title> prepared by the University of Kentucky Comptroller's Office/Financial Services Office for property acquired by State College/University of Kentucky between 1880 and 1992. The deeds also include property acquired by the university for its community college system (1957-1992).  The transcribed deeds date from July 1, 1880, to December 27, 1982, and are filed in order by a reference number assigned by the University of Kentucky Comptroller's Office.  The indeces date from 1961 and refer to the transcribed deeds by location, by grantor, and by year of acquisition.  There are also two sets of computer printouts or <title render="doublequote">reports</title> created by the University of Kentucky Finacial Services Office, one dated November 5, 1990, and one dated June 30, 1992. These reports list property information in chronological order, in order by county, by area code, and by UK reference number. The collection also includes a set of <title render="doublequote">Land Acquisition Form, Data Input Sheets</title> for entering information about property acquired by State College/University of Kentucky, 1880-1984, into a computerized spreadsheet or database. The input sheets are in chronological order.</p>
