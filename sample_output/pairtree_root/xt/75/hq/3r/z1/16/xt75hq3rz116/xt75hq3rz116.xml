    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Simon Kenton (1755-1836), of Virginia, left home as a teenager, heading west to Kentucky and serving there as a scout in Dunmore's War (1774), saving Daniel Boone's life in 1777, and joining the American frontier war experience during the Revolution, including some service as a scout with George Rogers Clark. Acquiring land in Mason County, Kentucky, in 1785, he lived there in relative prosperity, with service in the 1793-1794 campaigns of Anthony Wayne, until settling in Ohio in 1799. He served with a Kentucky regiment in the War of 1812, taking part in the battle of the Thames. His later years were spent in poverty, primarily due to defective titles to his land.</p>  </bioghist>
