    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William <emph render="doublequote">Bill</emph> Yewdale Adams (1927-2019), anthropologist and archaeologist and faculty member at the University of Kentucky, was born on August 6, 1927, in Los Angeles, California.  His parents were William Forbes Adams (1898-1935) and Lucy Mary (Wilcox) Adams (1898-1996) and he had one brother, Ernest Wilcox Adams (1926-2009). His father, a history professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, died in 1935.  Afer his death, the family moved to Window Rock, Arizona, when Lucy Adams found a position with the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the Navajo Reservation (now the Navajo Nation). Experiencing Navajo culture sparked Adams' interest in anthropology. Adams studied at Stanford University from 1943-1945, left for a year in the US Navy, then entered the University of California, Berekely, in 1946 to finish his undergraduate degree in anthropology in 1948. During World War II, his mother worked at the Manzanar, California, internment camp for Japanese-Americans, managing education and social welfare. Adams continued at the University of California for two years of graduate study, then dropped out of school, during which time he worked as an Indian trader on the Navajor Reservation. In 1954, he enrolled in the University of Arizona and earned his Ph.D. in anthropology in 1958. In 1955, Adams met and married another anthropologist, Nettie Alice Kesseler (1934-2024), from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who was completing her undergraduate degree at the University. </p><p>From 1955-1957, the Adams family ran the trading post and lived in a hogan at Shonto, Arizona, while Bill and Nettie also conducted fieldwork. This resulted in Bill's dissertation, <title render="italic">Shonto:  A Study of the Role of the Trader in a Modern Navajo Community</title>. In 1963, it was published as <title render="doublequote">Ethnology Bulletin 188</title> by the Smithsonian Institution. Between 1957 and 1959, Bill servied as Chief Archaeologist for the Glen Canyon Archaeological Salvage Project for the Museum of Northern Arizona. Bill and Nettie scouted sites requiring excavation along the San Juan and Colorado Rivers in advance of the Glen Canyon dam. </p><p>As a result of this experience, in 1959, Bill was appointed Director of Excavations for the Sudan Government Antiquities Service and as Liaison Officer for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as part of--and in advance of--salvage operations in the Nile Valley prior to the Aswan High Dam. Bill conducted aerial photography, scouted and excavated over 40 sites, oversaw excavations at more than 100 others, <emph render="doublequote">coodinated the activities of the [14] foreign missions that took part in the salvage campaign, and established most of their concession boundaries....It is he who developed the basic strategy and plan of [salvage operations] in Sudanese Nubia, created the master file and map of the sites reported by all the expeditions..., and devised the system of site numbering and recording now employed throughout Sudan</emph> (Sudan Archaeological Research Society, 2004). Bill also <emph render="doublequote">devised a typology for Nubian pottery still used today to date archaeological discoveries</emph> in ancient Nubia, today southern Egypt and northern Sudan (Anthropology News, 2021). The family lived in various places in Sudan, particularly Khartoum and Wadi Halfa. They had two sons, Ernest Adams (1960- ) and Edward Adams (1962- ).</p><p>The family decided that their children should be raised in the United States; thus, in 1966, they moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where Bill took a position as Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Kentucky (UK). He played a major role in developing the anthropology doctoral program, which was approved in 1968. He was promoted to full professor in 1971 and served as chair of the department from 1974-1978 and 1984-1986. He was an active and passionate teacher. In 1969 and 1979, he led a University of Kentucky archaological expedition at Kulubnarti at the head of Lake Nubia, in the Sudan. From 1972-1984, Bill and Nettie conducted excavations and fieldwork in partnership between the University of Kentucky and the Egypt Exploration Society at the ancient Lower Nubian town site Qasr Ibrim. Bill served as Archaeologist (1972-1984) and Field Director (1978-1982). Nettie was employed as Associate Curator at the University of Kentucky Webb Museum of Anthropology (1983-2001?) and served as Camp Manager (1976-1980) and Textile Analyst (1976-1988) for the Qasr Ibrim excavations. Bill retired from the University in July 1992. He founded the William Y. Adams Award for Excellence in Teaching by a Graduate Student.</p><p>During his scholarly career, Bill published over 200 articles and book chapters and 26 books with his own illustrations, including <title render="italic">Nubia: Corridor to Africa</title> (1977); <title render="italic">Ceramic Industries of Medieval Nubia</title> (1986); <title render="italic">Archaeological Typology and Practical Reality</title> (with brother, University of California, Berkeley, philosopher Ernest W. Adams, 1991); <title render="italic">The Philosophical Roots of Anthropology</title> (1998); and <title render="italic">Religion and Adaptation: An Ethno-logical Perspective</title> (2004). The excavations at Qasr Ibrim were the subject of a 1981 British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) documentary, <title render="italic">Discoveries</title>.  Nettie published more than 20 articles and book chapters.  Bill and Nettie traveled to Beijing, China, for teaching and study in 1989.</p><p>Bill earned many awards and honors, including a 1962 Guggenheim Fellowship; the 1978 Melville J. Herskovits Prize for his <title render="italic">Nubia: Corridor to Africa</title>; a Scholarly Achievement Award, Sudan Studies Association (1990); the Fritz Hintze Memorial Lecture, Berlin (1998); a Distinguished Contributions Award, Sudan Studies Association (1999); a Museum of Northern Arizona Distinguished Alumnus Award (1999); and the Sir Laurence Kirwan Memorial Lecture, London (2000). At the University of Kentucky he was awarded a Research Professorship (1979-1980); the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor Award (1979-1980); the Department of Anthropology Outstanding Teacher Award (1995); and was first faculty member inducted into the College of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame (2009). In 2006, he was awarded the country of Sudan's highest civilian honor, the Order of the Two Niles, Class II: Grand Officer. He was a founding member of the International Society for Nubian Studies, an Honorary Life Member of the Sudan Archaeological Research Society (Great Britain), and a Life Member of the Sudan Studies Association (United States).</p><p>
