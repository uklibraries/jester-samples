He was born in Lexington, Kentucky, on November 23, 1835, to Eliza Young and Joseph Milward. He attended Transylvania College in Lexington, read law, and worked as a harness maker. He enlisted as a private in the Union Army in August 1861. He initially worked as a drill master at Camp Dick Robinson. From there he transferred to the 18th Regiment where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. He and his regiment were the only regiment from Kentucky to participate in the infamous <emph render="doublequote">Sherman's March to the Sea</emph>. After the war, he returned to Lexington where he purchased the <title render="italic">National Unionist Newspaper</title>, renaming it <title render="italic">The Union Standard</title>.
