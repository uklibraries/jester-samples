    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Hubbard Kavanaugh Milward (known as H.K. Milward) served as a Lieutenant Colonel of the 18th Kentucky Regiment during the Civil War. He was born in Lexington, Kentucky, on November 23, 1835, to Eliza Young and Joseph Milward. He attended Transylvania College in Lexington, read law, and worked as a harness maker. He enlisted as a private in the Union Army in August 1861. He initially worked as a drill master at Camp Dick Robinson. From there he transferred to the 18th Regiment where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. He and his regiment were the only regiment from Kentucky to participate in the infamous <emph render="doublequote">Sherman's March to the Sea</emph>. After the war, he returned to Lexington where he purchased the <title render="italic">National Unionist Newspaper</title>, renaming it <title render="italic">The Union Standard</title>. After that publication ended, he was associated with the Republican newspaper, <title render="italic">The Statesman</title>. After briefly moving to Louisville to manage <title render="italic">The Daily Commercial</title>, he moved back to Lexington to work as coroner. In 1873, he married Kate White Adams of Barboursville, Kentucky. In 1876, President Grant appointed him Postmaster of Lexington. In 1891, he was elected Cashier of the National Exchange Bank. He died at the age of 57 on April 19, 1892 in Lexington. He was survived by his wife Kate and his children Susan, Amelia, and Henry Kavanaugh.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Hubbard Kavanaugh Milward diary (dated 1864-1865; 0.03 cubic feet; 1 folder) contains the handwritten account of Major Hubbard Kavanaugh Milward of Lexington, Kentucky, during his Civil War service in the Union Army. This collection also includes photocopies of each page of the diary, a brief family history of the Milward Family, an envelope addressed to Mr. Burton Milward of the Lexington Leader, and a photocopy of that envelope. The family history was written by Margaret Taylor Macdonald and contains biographical information concerning H.K. Milward and service in the army as well as his life after the war. </p><p>The diary entries are short and concise. Milward became a Colonel of the 18th Kentucky Regiment in the Union Army during the Civil War, and his diary recounts the day to day life of a soldier. The diary runs from October 6, 1864 to May 7, 1865, and mostly contains information about where his regiment marched and for how long. The diary includes entries pertaining to General William T. Sherman's campaign, the burning of Atlanta, the capturing of Savannah, and the freeing of enslaved persons. </p>  </scopecontent>
