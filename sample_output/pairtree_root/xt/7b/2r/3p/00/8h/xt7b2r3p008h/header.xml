          <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Frances Jewell McVey was born December 23, 1889, to Asa and Elizabeth Jewell in Harrison County, Kentucky. When she was a small child, the family (including brothers Robert and John) moved to Lexington, where Frances graduated from Sayre College before going to the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She received her Bachelor of Arts from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1913.  She went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1918, but she had already begun teaching at the University of Kentucky (UK), where she served as a professor in the English Department from 1915-1921.  McVey was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Kentucky in 1940.  </p><p>In addition to assuming the position of professor in the University of Kentucky English Department, McVey served as the Dean of Women from 1921-1923. In 1923, she married then President of UK, Frank LeRond McVey, and is perhaps best known for her role as the <emph render="doublequote">First Lady of Maxwell Place</emph> until her husband's retirement in 1940.  The McVeys were the first President's family to reside in Maxwell Place, and Frances Jewell McVey was widely praised for her graciousness as host of many teas and dinners.  Her interest in, and recipes for, traditional Kentucky and Southern foods were well known and publicized, as was her knowledge of gardening.</p><p>Throughout her life, Frances Jewell McVey remained active in UK campus affairs. She also served as a trustee of Vassar College, a member of the Lexington Board of Education, the National YWCA board, and the Frontier Nursing Service, and a charter member of the Lexington Junior League and the Business and Professional Women's Club.  </p><p>Frances Jewell McVey died on June 13, 1945, in Lexington, Kentucky, and was interred at the Lexington Cemetery.  </p><p>Elizabeth Jewell Davis (May 24, 1916-January 5, 1996) was a niece of Frances Jewell McVey.  Her father, John Barry Jewell (1886-1946), was McVey's brother.</p>
