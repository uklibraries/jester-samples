Of course such abrupt changes in a girl's life have not had the very best effect on her disposition and tend to give her a cynical and exaggerated opinion of the ills of this world.</title></p> <p>Mother was <title render="italic">very very beautiful</title>, married at seventeen, mother of boy and girl, divorced, remarried to <title render="italic">a kind handsome man [New Yorker?] to whom I was devoted.</title> Courts gave custody of both children to the mother but <title render="italic">for some reason</title> she gave up the son, ___and <title render="italic">kept me. At the tender age of six months I was taken abroad and there was practically brought up, coming to America frequently, but always returning to travel somewhere on the Continent. Till I was seven I spoke but French and queer English. I must say this as no one will ever see these papers and after all its [sic] past now I was a most attractive child of whom Mamma was very proud and extremely ambitious to have grow up clever and intelligent.</title> </p> <p>Governess: Le&#xF3;nie? studied language and music visited England and Switzerland, New York hotels, but mostly lived in Paris Kept earlier diaries</p> <p><title render="italic">&#x2026;fevered changes marked my youthful career. All Mamma's relations lived in Chicago, a town she thoroughly despised and where when visiting a doting grandmother I enjoyed undiluted [?] privileges and forgot the rigid discipline of French nurses.</title> </p> <p>at seven, Court de Rusle? [Cours de Russe, a language school?] in Paris, <title render="italic">where at my mother's request I was baptized a Catholic and where I was retained as a day pupil until my return to America.</title></p> <p>Mother ill, Henriette Metcalf placed in New York private school, Mother in hospital, suffered, operation, died. Sent to <title render="italic">Little Mother's</title> <title render="italic"> (a name we all gave our grandmother)</title> Convent of the Sacred Heart with cousin Mildred, summer at mother's home Greenmane [?] Farm, in Antioch, Illinois. <title render="italic">where I ran wild and learned much of the world's deceit and shallowness. My aunt a vain frivolous woman spoiled and neglected us in turn, totally disregarding that we were children (Mildred was fourteen and I was ten) and allowing us to hear and know things generally kept from youngsters. [7] </title></p> <p>Back to SH Convent, first communion, <title render="italic">Little Mother</title> dies, Henriette Metcalf and brother go to live with <title render="italic">real father and stepmother. Father's good looks and attractive ways speedily won my heart and though he teased me much I loved him dearly. I was prejudiced agains my father but his kindness won me over. Mrs. McCrea however failed to gain my affection. I would have been willing, may even been glad to have welcomed her as a good friend but her reception though doubtless intended to be kindly was cold, feelingless, and unresponsive. I lived with her a violet [?] made bearable by Mrs. Eckmay's (the housekeeper's) goodness to me.</title> </p> <p>Four years at a French school, Chevy Chase School, in Washington, <title render="italic">happy days</title>, summers at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin?, and with visits to New York. Life-long friends. Stayed with Mrs. Fisk, <title render="italic">a charming woman who was as good as a mother to me.</title> and met Genevieve Hall, a girl from Ridgeway PA, </p> <p><title render="italic">I find myself fifteen [written over earlier record] and a woman of some ambition to do something in the world but I feel my lack of concentration, my incapability to apply myself assiduously to one thing. I am restless as my Mother was and am only happy when some new project is astir&#x2014;when excitement is in store. At times I am positively morbid and discouraged when I think and fully realize my own utter[?] "littleness" and am spured [sic] on to do something that may gain me a prominent place and give me a name in the work of letters. I aspire to write&#x2014;that is the secret in a nut-shell. These pages are not examples of what I can write for they are to be merely receptacles of my moods, emotions, and passions should I harbor any; at present I am "heart-whole," and fancy free. So far my most ardent affections have pivoted and vacillated around fair women&#x2014;not necessarily beautifulness but fascinating ones to me. I say vacillated for to be truthful I am fickle and if my ideal is found to very much as any other mortal I generally place my affections elsewhere.</title> (Page 10)</p> <p><title render="italic">I have one passionate fondness and that is beauty&#x2014;"anything can be forgiven a beautiful woman" is my credo&#x2014;"Fascination" I believe to be the essential and foremost property in the world&#x2026;I have one fervent wish namely that no matter how old, bitter, or cynical I grow that I may always retain the certainty that no woman is thoroughly bad. It may seem a bold assertion from the pen of a supposedly unsophisticated girl but these are my unusual thoughts that none shall ever read, so the [12]criticism of these words will be made by my older more mature most experienced self and I hope wiser self in years to come. But my observations of woman have driven me to rather astoundingly to [sic?] the primly properly correct class of people&#x2026;Having associated with two distinct different classes of women I am honest in saying I have judged both.</title> </p> <p>Mother's friends were part of the <title render="italic">Smart Set</title> <title render="italic">not averse to [13] mild drinking or smoking and did not fear the world's censure should they be seen with one whose reputation bore no close investigation. They were women of the World with ordinary faults of womankind, the same love of flattery and adulation, probably taking the same pleasure in gossip but though their ways and modes of living should get [?] frivolity and contempt for conventionality&#x2014;to the outside world I firmly believe that no better woman ever existed. Lend a helping hand to the fallen one and [14] women who "having suffered" know of sympathy. Then there is the rich embittered woman whose dollars cannot restore her youth, and who sullenly banished all attractive woman from about her, retaining merely a group of sponges who patiently dance attendance in hopes of (figuratively speaking) scraps [15] from the banquet table&#x2026; subjugation to the will of an other merely for the sake of social position is inconceivable for the mind of an independent person.</title></p> <p>July 16, 1905 18- 20 Has been to Yellowstone Park and Livingston, consults a clairvoyant for fifty cents, finds the woman ridiculous, living a life <title render="italic">contempt, ridicule, drudgery and eventually death,</title> her grammar was <title render="italic">side-splitting</title> Predicts that Henriette Metcalf will marry twice and have three children, two of whom would die, a boy living&#x2026; Henriette Metcalf wants a little girl because <title render="italic">girls are nearer to the mother.</title> But wants husband she can respect and who would respect and have confidence in her. She notes the husband of a traveling companion, Mrs. Fisk, whose husband is incapacitated by drink and yet the wife is not repelled. 21 <title render="italic">One's physical condition is such a prosaic thing that it seems to me the less alluded to the better, &#x2026; why not leave the animal bodily facts of nature out as much as possible, and speak of the spiritual and more poetic [22] ones.</title> 22 admires Mrs. Laflin <title render="italic">lovely to look upon</title> <title render="italic">eccentric, unconventional disposition has made her many enemies</title> model wife <title render="italic">strange masculine side</title> 23 Jovial stories.</p> <p>Page 28-64 August 7, 1905, back to English, 66 despises dances 67 likes <title render="doublequote">Garden of Allah</title> by Robert Hitchens.

All that seems foolish to me, but of course I've not had much experience being only fifteen [overwriting another number, sixteen?] and not having gone out much. (78) Still I hope I shall keep, what older people call my illusions, I'd hate to think everyone was hypocritical. I dined at Mrs. Harahan's while in town and came home with&#x2014; "Mr. Harry Baldwin, a charming man from New Orleans" I happened to remark that I loved women and admired so many of them. He smiled and said, "you will get over that when you know them better."</title> </p> <p>80: <title render="italic">Men seem to have so little respect for woman that are not related to them. Not that I am prudish.</title></p> <p>80-81: Bill Martin remarried "merely to have a good house-keeper for his children." His first wife, <title render="italic">good and very beautiful</title> left him because <title render="italic">of his selfishness</title>.</p> <p>81-82: September 13, 1905. Things gone from <title render="italic">bad to worse</title> with stepmother. Henriette Metcalf wished to <title render="italic">go abroad and never return to this beastly country; for five years I have endured the most unpleasant home life. Had I been a boy it would have been different, but a girl is (83) always and everlastingly hampered: --It's difficult to philosophyse on nothing. There is nothing to hang on to.</title></p> <p>83-86: October 15, 1905 Has spent a week in New York and nearly two weeks in Darien, Connecticut, with <title render="italic">artist Uncle: and his two children Helen and Sam.</title> Then to Richmond Horse Show. <title render="italic">love seeing the beautiful women.</title> Describes beautiful women and several attractive men and boys. (86) <title render="italic">I so much want to be loved&#x2014;dreadfully by some fine honest man.</title></p> <p>88: October 21, 1905: going back to live with Madame Sewell and her daughter, <title render="italic">Italians</title> (89) in Washington</p> <p>88-89: October 28, 1905: Henriette Metcalf <title render="italic">frightfully lonesome</title> in Washington</p> <p>89: to the theatre three times, including Olga Nethersole in <title render="doublequote">The Labyrinth</title>, what memories she called up to my mind; <title render="italic">ten years, a long long time and she was sending her companion Madame Gesind [?] to be my governess, it was a the Savoy in New York and I was a little thing five [again apparently corrected], Mamma was living then and I was so happy. I don't know what is that I can't seem to be that any more, there is an indescribable longing within me, a longing for, I know now what. I thought a dog, a fox terrier for which I payed [sic] $5.00 he is company too and I am so glad to have him</title>&#x2026;</p> <p>90: Last night Blanche Bates in <title render="doublequote">The Girl of the Golden West</title>, <title render="italic">splendid play</title> Questions theatrical <title render="italic">happiness</title> as she knows so few <title render="italic">really contented</title> people. <title render="italic">Apparently I myself have all that I wish for, but, no, my independence in so many little things, the very things other girls have a mother to tell them what is right, a mother to take interest. I have no one.</title></p> <p>91: <title render="italic">but I am nearly sixteen [again apparently corrected] and the craving [?] need of some one to advise me is dawning upon me for the first time. I want to cry, but I won't; it would not do any good. Father and Mother may come to see me soon on their way back to Chicago. My brother is back from Idaho. I love him very much but he does not care anything about being cared for; I have not seen him yet--, as I have already gone when he returned. I wish I could go out and live on a ranch with some one I liked.</title> Mrs. Massall is getting divorced <title render="italic">why oh why will she give up her little children, the girl especially, how can she?</title> (92) <title render="italic">I thank heaven every day I live that my mother took me.

She is charming, not beautiful, bur very womanly and winning. I am afraid I loved her to extinction, its strange that she has never married, I'm beginning to think that after all married life is the happiest if one meets the right man.</title> 94: <title render="italic">hope she may someday call Miss Allen "friend."</title></p> <p>Note: Henriette Metcalf saw Viola Allen in Clyde Fitch's <title render="doublequote">The Toast of the Town</title> on October 30, 1905, at the New National Theatre in Washington, D. C. Henriette Metcalf found the play <title render="italic">Excellent</title> and Allen <title render="italic">charming.</title> She went back to see a second performance, <title render="italic">Better than the first time,</title> and found Allen <title render="italic">more than very charming,</title> on November 4, 1905, See Metcalfe, Henrietta, <title render="italic">Theatre Journal 1905,</title> 62. She also saw <title render="italic">as ever bewitching</title> Maude Adams in <title render="doublequote">Peter Pan</title>, but "did not care for the play." (October 21, 1905, bad seats, New National, See Theatre Journal 1905, 59). Henriette Metcalf watched Nethersole from the first row in <title render="doublequote">The Labyrinth</title>, <title render="italic">essentially French,</title> at the New National, (October 25, 1905, TJ 1905, 60).

I do like frivolous things sometimes and I'm not constant and I'm fond of gossip.</title> Miriam, a friend, <title render="doublequote">does not sympathize w' my liking of women, that is the French in her.</title> <title render="doublequote">&#x2026;I've never loved a simple man. They don't appeal to me the way women do, I don't understand them, maybe its because none have ever been in love with me.</title></p> <p>97: Henriette Metcalf speaks to father <title render="italic">over the long distance from here to New York,</title> seemed <title render="italic">discouraged</title> about Henriette Metcalf's brother who wants to go back west. <title render="italic">I wish he would not, I want my brother, I've no one so near me aside from Father.</title> </p> <p>98: <title render="italic">A french [sic] temperament in an American girl will never do, so that all my impulses, my mood, my emotions, all much be conquered, I must appear calm, self-possessed, and all the while I want to cry to be comforted, to be loved.</title> </p> <p>99: November 15, 1905.

I started on a story the other night and have not had the courage to go on, the "nerve," I should say, a story sounds so differently at twelve at night than at light in the morning.</title> </p> <p>105: December 28, 1905, New York City.
