Lee Etching, Stevie Jones Age 12.</p> <p>Inserted in back cover, 1919 American Red Cross Christmas stamps. Henriette Metcalf used this volume as a diary with mostly short entries, detailing the day-to-day events in the Metcalf household. Henriette Metcalf plays poker, attends the theatre, opera, moving pictures, and concerts, worries when her children Rosalind and Addison are ill, and notes the departures and returns of her husband, artist Willard Metcalf. </p> <p>Henriette Metcalf appears to have worked at this time in assisting placement of orphaned or abandoned children; she details the arrival and placement of each child, noting the disposition of each child, and often mentioning the attachment of her own children to these transient guests. Transactions involving the placement of children often seem to occur at Sherry's Restaurant. Odd references to operation of postgraduate, suggesting abortion or hysterectomy. </p> <p>Metcalf's work with children was through the Speedwell Society, founded in Morristown, with a branch in Yonkers. The Speedwell Society was dedicated to placing orphaned or abandoned children in homes, no institutions, and in 1919, was responding to the increased number of orphans following the recent epidemic of influenza. Yvonne Gall's benefit concert of March 28, 1919, was organized by Mrs. Henry Addison Alexander. Volunteers with the Speedwell included Mrs. Simeon B. Chapin, Mrs. Brayton Ives, Mrs. Arthur F. Mason, Mrs. James A. Burden, Mrs. Walter Lambert, Mrs. William H. Burr, Miss Dorothy Donnelly, Mrs. Frank S. Fielder, Mrs. Henry Dwight Chapin, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Mrs. Stephen S.
