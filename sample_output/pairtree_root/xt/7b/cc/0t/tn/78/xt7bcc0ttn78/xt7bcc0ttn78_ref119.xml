She often watched performances from the front row or a box seat, not only the most expensive seats, but those closest to the actors. Like many followers of the theatre in her time, and certainly like many financially-comfortable young women of her era, McCrea kept a record of what she saw in a special album designed to hold the cast list of each event, accompanied by printed prompts to note the date, the theatre, her companions, and her reactions to the play. As mirrored in her journals, her strongest reactions were usually reserved for female stars and leading ladies. Throughout her life, she saved programs as souvenirs of her theatre experiences. After her marriages, Mrs. Metcalf may have served as drama editor for Vanity Fair (documentation needed), but she turned her hand early to dramatic criticism, and several of her typewritten reviews are inserted in the Theatre Records; the history of their submission and publication is uncertain. In the years covered in her Theatre Records, H.M. attended the principal theatres in Chicago (her hometown), New York (on visits), and Washington, D. C., (while at school, often in the company of her French-speaking teachers). She also attended theatres in Richmond, VA, and in Portland, OR, while visiting friends there. She also haunted the theatres of Paris and in Germany. In general, this guide to H.M.'s theatre records lists stars with above title billing first, then the title, date of attendance, venue, and notes of interest, including Henriette Metcalf's companion, and notable cast members, playwrights, directors, as well as accompanying ephemera, including notation of those productions reviewed by <title render="doublequote">H.
