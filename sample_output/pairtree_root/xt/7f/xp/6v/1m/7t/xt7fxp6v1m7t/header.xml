      <p>Mary E. (Shrewsbury) Van Meter (1828-1893) was married to William Steele Van Meter, a wealthy Commission Merchant in Bowling Green Kentucky. His father, Jacob Van Meter, owned approximately 5000 acres of farmland in the area and engaged in mercantile pursuits.  When Union troops approached Bowling Green in February 1862, Mary, William, and her brother-in-law Charles, along with several of their enslaved persons, fled across the Kentucky border into Tennessee. After the Civil War, William and his brother Charles owned and operated a hotel at Grayson Springs in Kentucky.</p>
