          <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>David Davis Bell (D.D. Bell) was born in 1849 to Henry Bell and Clara Davis. He grew up in Woodside, a large home completed in 1846 in Lexington, Kentucky. The home was passed along to D.D. upon the death of his father in 1883. After an 1884 fire, D.D. worked with Cincinnati architect Samuel Eugene Des Jardins to rebuild the home, which is present-day Bell Place. During his life, D.D. made his fortune as a dry goods merchant and kept show horses across the state. In 1880, he married Sydney Sayre and they had one daughter, Clara D. Bell in 1884. Clara grew up in the reconstructed Bell Place with her mother and father, until his death in 1892. Sydney Sayre was remarried shortly after to Arthur Cary.</p><p>D.D. gave Clara D. Bell the majority of his fortune and all of Bell estate. Clara enjoyed showing horses in her free time and at the age of 21, she married Julius Walsh Jr. of St. Louis. Clara would continue her involvement in business, travel, and social gatherings. Later the couple would divorce in 1911 and Clara would eventually move into the Plaza Hotel in New York, selling most of the land surrounding Bell Place. Clara passed away in 1940 and gave Bell Place to the city of Lexington.</p>
