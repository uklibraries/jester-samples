          <head>Historical and Biographical Note</head>
      <p>In 1971, the University of Kentucky Board (UK) of Trustees established the  position of Assistant to the Vice President for Student Affairs for Minority Students and hired Jerry L. Stevens to fill it. The role of this position was to advise, assist, and counsel the University and its administration "in the interest of improving current efforts and developing new services for minority students." Simultaneously, the Office of Minority Student Affairs was created. The office reported to the Vice President for Student Affairs and the goal of the office was to "assist both students and University staff in the development of coordinated programs and supportive services for minority students when specific needs cannot be met effectively through the use of existing resources." In addition, the office provided institutional support and representation for underrepresented student, faculty, and staff populations at the university. </p><p>In July 1975, John T. Smith was hired for a newly-created position, the Vice President for Minority Affairs, which became Vice Chancellor for Minority Affairs June 1982 when the University instituted a chancellor system.  This position was over the areas of Minority Student Affairs, Affirmative Action, and Employee Counseling.  William C. Parker took over the position in August 1984, and Lauretta Byars was hired as acting Vice Chancellor in July 1990.  After a national search, Byars was appointed permanently in April 1991.  </p><p>In October 1991, the Lyman T. Johnson Alumni Association (affiliated with the UK Alumni Association) as part of the celebration of  the 20th anniversary of the office.  During this time, the office focused on developing educational and cultural programming, the recruitment and retention of minority students and non-academic counseling.  In July 2001, the position of Vice Chancellor of Minority Affairs was renamed Associate Provost of Minority Affairs. 
      Based on one of the recommendations of then-President Lee T. Todd to the Board of Trustees, the Office of Minority Affairs was renamed the Office of Multicultural and Academic Affairs effective July 1, 2003. Byars continued as head of the unit as the Associate Provost for Multicultural and Academic Affairs. The units and programs under this office expanded to include the UK Center for Academic Resources and Enrichment Services (UK CARES), the Freshman Summer Program, the Critical First-Year Program, the Science Living-Learning Community, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Cultural Center, Multicultural Student Programming, and Student Support Services. The name change reflected the broader range of services and broader mission acquired by the office, which was to "assume university-wide responsibility to lead diversity and equity efforts across the campus."  </p><p>Just a year later, in July 2004, the Board of Trustees established a new administrative position reporting to the President and the Provost, the Vice President for University Initiatives/Associate Provost for Multicultural Affairs.  Under this new position, the Board consolidated the areas of the Vice President for Academic Outreach and Public Service, the Vice President for Research and Economic Development, and the Associate Provost for Multicultural and Academic Affairs.  The new position was "responsible for outreach and service programs on behalf of the communities throughout Kentucky, particularly in Appalachia, promoting the University's ability to develop and evaluate solutions to some of the state's most persistent social, economic, health, and educational problems, improving the recruitment and academic success of multicultural students, and providing oversight of the University's efforts to enhance its overall diversity."  Also, in 2004, Lauretta Byars left the university, and William H. Turner was appointed to this new position.  In September 2005, Philip A. Greasley was appointed as Associate Vice President for University Initiatives.  In June 2006, the position name changed slightly to Vice President for University Engagement/Associate Provost for Multicultural and Academic Affairs.</p><p>In November 2006, the Board of Trustees established a Vice President for Institutional Diversity to serve as the "...senior administrative officer responsible for promoting collaboration across faculty, staff, administration, and students in earnest pursuit of the university's diversity goals."  In 2008, Judy "JJ" Jackson was hired into this new position, the office was renamed the Office for Institutional Diversity, and the position of Associate Provost for Multicultural Affairs was eliminated.  Currently, the office now manages several units including the Center for Academic Resources and Enrichment Services (CARES) department; Center for Graduate and Professional Diversity Initiatives department; Office of LGBTQ* Resources department; Martin Luther King Center; the Kentucky-West Virginia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation; Inclusive Excellence and Education; and Student Support Services. The departments are known to "work across academic and non-academic units to implement ideas, collaborate on outreach and recruitment efforts, and to enhance student retention and achievement." Following Judy Jackson's retirement in 2015, Sonja Feist-Price (2017-2020) and Gerald Wright (2020- ) have led the unit. 
      The complete list of leaders includes Jerry L. Stevens (1971-1975). John T. Smith (1975-1984), William C. Parker (1984-1990), Lauretta Byars (1990-2004), William H. Turner (2004-2005), Philip A. Greasley (2005-2008), Judy "JJ" Jackson (2008-2015), Sonja Feist-Price (2017-2020), and Gerald C. Wright (2020- ).</p><p>Lauretta Flynn Byars was born on April 4th, 1949. She obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree from Morehead State University in 1970, her Masters in Social Work in 1972 from the University of Kentucky, and her Doctorate in Education in 1982 from the University of Kentucky. A member of the faculty of the UK College of Social Work, prior to her appointment at UK as Vice Chancellor of Minority Affairs in 1990, Byars served as Director of the Undergraduate Program (1985-1990), Assistant Dean for Student Affairs in the UK College of Social Work (1980-1985), and as Executive Director of the federal Office of Education grant-funded University Educational Talent Search (1972-1979). In 2001, her title changed to Associate Provost for Multicultural and Academic Affairs, heading the activities of that office. Her responsibilities included budgeting, personnel management, planning, recruiting and retaining students, supporting minority faculty and staff, and helping to ensure a positive and supportive environment for diversity at the University.  She is noted for transforming the office from Minority Affairs to the Office Of Multicultural and Academic Affairs (2003), generating more than $4.5 million in external funding, and establishing the Jamal Mashburn Endowment Scholarship and critical first-year retention programs. Byars left UK in 2004 to become the Vice President for Institutional Relations and Public Service at Prairie View A&amp;M University in Prairie View, Texas. In 2008, she was appointed Vice President for Student Affairs and Institutional Relations. She retired from Prairie View A&amp;M in 2018.</p><p>Sources:
