          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Women's travel diary (dated 1924, 1949-1950; 0.06 cubic feet; 1 folder) comprises a travel diary that documents the European trips taken by unidentified women in the early and mid-twentieth century. The 1924 journey covered Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Scotland. The woman wrote about the people she encountered on the ship to Europe, the qualities of the cities and hotels stayed in, her opinions on local food. She also frequently compared the cities to the United States. In some of the entries, the diary discusses the history behind sites she visited, including the Lion of Lucerne, various churches in Italy, the Louvre, and The Hague. The 1949-1950 trip seems to be written by a different woman, many of the pages documenting the trip are torn out, only the last three pages remain which detail the woman's return to the United States and difficulties getting through customs.</p><p>The Women's travel diary is part of the Wade Hall Collection of American Letters, which includes correspondence and diaries from all over North America covering the time period of the Civil to Korean Wars. The materials were collected by Wade Hall and document everyday men and women.  </p>
