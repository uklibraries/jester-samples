      <p>Mary Dunn was born September 19, 1930, in Nashville, TN, to Dr. Raphael Semmes Duke and Louise (Potter) Duke. Mary graduated from Ward Belmont in Nashville, TN, and moved to Lexington in 1948 to study at the University of Kentucky. After graduating, Mary remained in Lexington. She married university administrator Keller Dunn and had two daughters. In the 1960s, as issues of civil rights, feminism, and the Vietnam War were in the national spotlight, Mary became more politically aware. In 1967, she joined the Lexington Peace Council, which prepared education resources in opposition to the Vietnam War. During this time, through exposure to national conversations and events as well as books such as Marilyn French's <emph render="italic">The Women's Room</emph>, she became more active in the feminism movement. Around this time, she and her husband divorced; Mary attributed this separation to their different goals in life.  </p><p>Mary was very active in various political movements and conversations both in Lexington and nationally. She was very vocal in opposition to the purchase of South African granite for use in a Lexington library building and, in response, worked with local groups to raise money to send to South African refugee camps in South Africa. She was also vocal about the prevalence of prejudice and racism in Lexington. She was an outspoken critic of Gov. A.B. <emph render="doublequote">Happy</emph> Chandler following his using a racial slur at a University of Kentucky Board of Trustees Committee meeting and advocated for his resignation. Additionally, following the renaming of Walnut Street to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, and she warned against interpreting the decision as evidence that racism does not exist in Lexington. Nationally, she became heavily involved with the Democratic Socialists of America and served on the group's national executive board. She was active in the National Rainbow Coalition and the formation of a Kentucky chapter of the organization. She was also a vocal opponent of U.S. involvement in Central America. She campaigned for Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential bid and served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that year. She was also involved with the National Abortion Rights Action League.</p><p>Mary died on June 24, 2022.  </p><p>Sources:
