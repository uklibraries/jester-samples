    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Doris Yvonne Wilkinson is a sociologist, a leader in national sociological organizations, and the first full-time female African American faculty member at the University of Kentucky.  Her research interests include Critical Race Theory, the sociology of health and illness, class and gender, social change and social movements, and occupations and professions.  Wilkinson was born in 1936 in Lexington, Ky.  She graduated from Lexington's black high school, Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School, in 1954, where she was valedictorian of her graduating class and homecoming queen.  That fall she enrolled at the University of Kentucky (UK) as a member of the first class of African American undergraduate students.  She graduated in 1958, the first African American woman to earn an undergraduate degree from UK.  Wilkinson earned a master's degree (1960) and a doctorate (1968) in medical sociology from Case Western Reserve University, as well as a master's of public health degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1985.  In 1967, she was appointed a professor of sociology at UK, the first full-time female African American faculty member at the university.  From 1970-1985, she was on the faculty at Macalester College, St. Paul, Minn., and in 1985, returned to UK.  She was a visiting Ford Foundation Fellow at Harvard University, 1989-1990, and has also been a visiting professor at the University of Virginia and Smith College.  Wilkinson's books as author or editor include <title render="italic">Black Male/White Female:  Perspectives on Interracial Marriage and Courtship</title> (1975) and <title render="italic">The Black Male in America: Perspectives on his Status in Contemporary Society</title> (1977); <title render="italic">Alternative Health Maintenance and Healing Systems for Families</title> (19897); and <title render="italic">Race, Class, &amp; Gender:  Common Bonds, Different Voices</title> (1997).  Her work appears in <title render="italic">Imagine a World: Pioneering Black Women Sociologists</title> (2009). </p><p>At UK, Wilkinson founded the first social club for Black women, the Forum for Black Faculty, the Carter G. Woodson Lecture Series for untenured faculty, the Black Women's Conference, and was a founder and first director of Black Studies at the university, which she renamed the African American Studies and Research Program.  The university has established the Doris Wilkinson Distinguished Professorship in Sociology and the Humanities; the Doris Y. Wilkinson Conference Room in Breckinridge Hall, and the Doris Y. Wilkinson Award for Leadership.  She was named to the UK Hall of Distinguished Alumni in 1989 and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 2019.</p><p>In 1988, Wilkinson received a grant from the Kentucky Humanities Council to study and plan a community-wide exhibit on early African American physicians from 1890-1950.  The resulting 1988 exhibit was titled <title render="doublequote">Forgotten Pioneers in a Southern Community: Black Physicians in Lexington from 1890 to 1950.</title>  In 1989, the exhibit was made into a semi-documentary by Kentucky Education Television and also traveled to local, state, and national libraries and museums. Additionally, this research produced two general education reference resources, the 1998 Directory of African Americans in Lexington, Kentucky, and a <emph render="doublequote">Guide to the African American Heritage Trail in Downtown Lexington, Kentucky.</emph></p><p>Wilkinson has been awarded other grants and contracts, including a 1978 grant from the National Institute of Education under the auspices of the American Sociological Association to create a Research Skills Institute for women and minorities.  In 1982, she was awarded a contract from the Southern Education Foundation to study Black colleges and universities.</p><p>Wilkinson has served in leadership positions in a variety of organizations.  In 1972, she was appointed to the Department of Interior Task Force on the National Parks System.  In 1976, she was appointed to a National Endowment for the Humanities Public Program review panel.  In the same year, she was appointed chair of a social science panel for the National Science Foundation's Women in Science program.  From 1980-1984, she served on the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Cancer Institute.  In 1982, She was elected Vice President of the Eastern Sociological Society and was appointed to the Board of Overseers of Case Western Reserve University. In 1985, she was elected President of the Society for the Study of Social Problems.  She has also served as President of the Eastern Sociological Society and Vice President of the American Sociological Association.</p><p>Wilkinson has garnered national and local awards, including the American Sociological Association's Dubois-Johnson Frazier Award (1988) for her exemplary contributions to minority research and the field of race relations; the University of Kentucky Great Teacher Award (1992); the Distinguished Professor Award from the University of Kentucky College of Arts and Sciences (1992); the Public Understanding of Sociology Award from the American Sociological Association (2010); and the Lifetime Achievement Award from Women Leading Kentucky. </p><p>Resources:</p><p>2018ua031:  <title render="doublequote">Doris Wilkinson,</title> General Reference Faculty/Staff Biographical Files, University of Kentucky Special Collections Research Center.</p><p>2010ua009:  <title render="doublequote">Wilkinson, Doris, 1989-1996, undated,</title> University of Kentucky Department of Public Relations Records, University of Kentucky Special Collections Research Center. </p><p><title render="doublequote">Doris Wilkinson.</title> University of Kentucky College of Arts and Sciences:  Sociology. https://soc.as.uky.edu/users/dwilkin</p><p><title render="doublequote">Doris Wilkinson.</title> University of Kentucky College of Social Work. https://socialwork.uky.edu/people/doris-wilkinson/</p><p><title render="doublequote">Doris Wilkinson Award Statement.</title> American Sociological Association. https://www.asanet.org/news-and-events/member-awards/public-understanding-sociology-asa-award/doris-wilkinson-award-statement</p><p><title render="doublequote">Doris Wilkinson Receives Honors. </title> <title render="italic">ASA Footnotes, </title> Vol., 36, No. 5 (May-June 2008). https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/mayjun08/doris.html</p><p><title render="doublequote">Doris Y.
