      <p>Whitney M. Young Sr. was an educator and civil rights leader. Young was born in Paynes Depot, Kentucky to Taylor Young and Annie Henderson during 1897 (Notable Kentucky African Americans, 2019). Young was a graduate of Lincoln Institute, an all-black boarding school that operated from 1912-1966 in Shelby County, Kentucky. Young also attended Louisville Municipal College, Monrovia College, and Fisk University. After serving in the armed forces, Young married Laura E. Ray. He ultimately became the Lincoln Institute's first African-American director from 1935-1966. Young was active in, and helmed, several education and civil rights related groups and organizations. He acted as the president of the Kentucky Negro Educational Association from 1948-1956, and as assistant supervisor of the States Department of Education Negro Education division. Young was also a member of the Southern Association Accreditation Committee of Kentucky, Credentials Committee of the Kentucky Education Association, State Committee of Moral and Spiritual Values, Kentucky Bookmobile Committee, Red Cross Hospital Board, and the Board of Trustees of Lincoln Institute. Young's children were similarly active in education and civil rights. Young was the father of fellow civil rights activist, Whitney M. Young Jr, along with his other children Eleanor Young and Arnita Young Boswell, and founded the Whitney M. Young Memorial Foundation after his son's death. Both of Young's daughters became university professors, at the University of Louisville and the University of Chicago respectively. </p><p>Sources:</p><p>Notable Kentucky African Americans.
